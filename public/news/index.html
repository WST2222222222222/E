      </p>
      <p>
        It's with great pleasure that I announce the 5th and final major version of track.easterbunny.cc - Version 7 for 2024. 
        <br><br>
        Version 7 of the track.easterbunny.cc brings some nice-to-have features into the tracker to further enhance the tracking experience. It represents the final vision of track.easterbunny.cc and the Easter Bunny Tracker that I've always wanted to make since 2019.
        <br><br>
        Without further ado, let's get into the planned changes for this year!
        <br><br>
        <b>Multi-metrics support - finally!</b><br>
        On both mobile and desktop devices, you'll finally be able to view multiple metrics at once. This means you can easily keep an eye on all your favorite metrics without flipping between them!
        <br><br>
        This feature will be activated through settings by changing the metric visible setting into checkboxes from radio buttons. From there, you can select as many metrics as you want to be visible.
        <br><br>
        <b>Baskets prepared metric during pre-tracking</b>
        For our final year of pre-tracking, we're going out with a bang making the experience more interactive. Throughout pre-tracking, you'll be able to see the number of baskets prepared & loaded as the Easter Bunny's helpers get everything ready for liftoff.
        <br><br>
        You'll be able to see these metrics on both desktop and mobile devices.
        <br><br>
        <b>Spoken pronunciation in the stop information window</b><br>
        Have you ever been exploring the map and come across a stop that you've wanted to know how it's pronounced? With track.easterbunny.cc Version 7, you'll now easily be able to listen to the pronunciation of a city name!
        <br><br>
        At the top of the stop information window, you'll find a speaker icon that allows you to play the pronunciation for each city on both mobile and desktop devices.
        <br><br>
        Right now we're planning for all voices to be in US English and TTS generated, however, depending on the complexity of this feature we may be able to get voices in UK, Australian, and Canadian English and have it automatically switch depending on your device's locale.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Easter Bunny goes to space in the final release!</b><br>
        A long time ago, we had planned for the Easter Bunny to show a stop on the ISS, but unfortunately this feature never manifested. Nonetheless, for the final TEBCC release we'll be adding this feature! More information about it will come in a developer update, but this is your confirmation that it'll happen!
        <br><br>
        <b>Unconfirmed features</b><br>
        For Version 7, there's two unconfirmed features at this time. They may get implemented depending on time constraints and the difficulty of them development-wise.
        <br><br>
        First, we're thinking of potentially adding some new metrics this year. Our first idea is an overall progress metric so you can get a birds-eye view of how the Easter Bunny's journey is going so far.
        <br><br>
        Second, we're thinking about improving map movements especially in large cities. This would depict the Easter Bunny slowing down when reaching/leaving large cities, on top of the current arrival system that we have.
        <br><br>
        More information and updates on the status of these features will come at a later time!
        <br><br>
        <b>Other small features & improvements</b><br>
        With every TEBCC release there'll be some smaller improvements to refine the tracking experience. In no particular order for this year:
        <ul>
          <li>Improving reliability of the tracker compared to the v6 run (hopefully no more white screens!)</li>
          <li>Slightly improved stop detection compared to last year.</li>
          <li>New feature to enable stop arrival times when hovering over baskets on the map</li>
          <li>New feature for streamers to disable the distance from you metric in the cycle of metrics so it cannot accidentally be shown on streams.</li>
          <li>Updating the FAQ pages to accurately reflect the shutdown of the tracker.</li>
        </ul>
        I hope you're excited for these new features to come in Version 7 of track.easterbunny.cc. Development will be getting underway soon!
        <br><br>
        Tracking for the final time gets underway on Saturday, March 30, 2024 at 2 AM EDT.

      <p class="lead">An announcement on the future of track.easterbuny.cc</p>
      <p>Posted: May 28, 2023 <br>
        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('141'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-141" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-141</a>
      </p>
      This is a post I always knew I would have to write at some point, and today is that day.
      <br><br>
      Back in 2019 when I started making track.easterbunny.cc, I had no clue what it would turn into today. TEBCC has ballooned into a project that has far exceeded my expectations of what it could do, and honestly, what I thought I could even make.
      <br><br>
      From a very basic tracker with just a few thousand visitors in 2019, to one of the most complex trackers on the internet five runs later getting tens of thousands of hits year after year - it's truly been an honor to make and build this tracker that's received around half a million hits during its lifetime. I have learned so much from running this tracker, but in the process, been honored by the outpouring of support, enthusiasm, and impact the tracker has had on so many people across the world. Thank you to everyone who visited TEBCC at some point between 2019 and now, it really means the world to me.
      <br><br>
      Nonetheless, running and managing TEBCC is a time and financial burden, especially as a solo developer. Especially as I move into a new phase of life, I cannot make the guarantee that I will be able to run the tracker at the same level that I do now.
      <br><br>
      I contemplated my options for running the tracker into the future - paths including lowering costs, turning off Twitter updates, and leaving the tracker in a state of maintenance without new features, all of which would lower the operational and financial overheads that the tracker has.
      <br><br>
      However, doing such goes against why I made track.easterbunny.cc in the first place - to create one of the best Easter Bunny tracker experiences on the internet. It feels wrong to leave the tracker to die a slow death, eventually to be succeeded by another website and for me to pull the plug somewhere down the road.
      <br><br>
      With this in mind, I have made the decision that <b>track.easterbunny.cc will no longer run after Easter 2024.</b> Easter 2024 will be the 6th and final run of track.easterbuny.cc.
      <br><br>
      Shutting down the tracker in 2024 was what I determined to be in the tracker's best interests and within reason of what I can commit to for the tracker's future. I want this amazing tracker to end on a high note, not a low note of a slow death. I know that I can commit to providing the best tracking experience for one more year, and that's exactly what's gonna happen.
      <br><br>
      So, where does this leave the tracker? 
      <br><br>
      For 2024, Version 6.2 will be released which focuses on some improvements I wanted to make but didn't have time to do in the React refactor. It'll be the final vision of what I wanted TEBCC to be, and I hope you're excited to see what changes come along. There's no set list of features right now, this will be determined and announced at a later date.
      <br><br>
      As of right now, messages have been put up on the tracker indicating this shutdown at the moment. Through the summer, I'll comprehensively update the entire tracker to reflect that our final run will be in 2024.
      <br><br>
      The 2024 run of the tracker will be like any other run in the last 5 years. However, once tracking is completed and the map screen resets after a few days, there will no longer be a countdown, rather, a message indicating the tracker has shut down.
      <br><br>
      I know this news will come as a shock - especially with the knowledge that there is no alternate tracker out there with a similarly complex tracking experience. But in life, the greatest things always come to an end at some point. We shouldn't take them for granted - this tracker included. But once the tracker shuts down, I hope you can look back at some of the fond memories of using this website.
      <br><br>
      I'm still working to get the tracker open-sourced for v6 and v6.2 will be no different. The legacy of TEBCC will live on through the codebase, allowing anyone who's technically inclined to fire up their own tracker and build on top of what I've made. This is why I open-sourced TEBCC, because I wanted to make sure the innovations and inventions I've made can live on once the tracker itself is gone.
      <br><br>
      Thank you once again for supporting TEBCC. I'm looking forward to the 2024 run of the tracker, so look forward to more information about v6.2 coming soon!
      <br><br>
      All the best,<br>

        Hello all - the post-mortem for the 2023 run of the tracker is now available. This is a detailed description of the issues in production that led to the tracker failures. This is a lengthy report with a lot of technical terms, but hopefully you can learn something from our failures about what happened this year. <br><br>
        The report also outlines what we'll be doing for 2024 so ensure these issues are much less likely to occur in production. <br><br>

      <p>
        Easter 2023 - our fifth year of operations. This year was going to be a huge year, with the first running of our React based tracker based on a whole new UI. We had also wondered with 4 years of growth behind us, would we keep on growing?
        <br><br>
        While things looked promising in the early hours of tracking, unfortunately, we suffered from technical issues that meant the tracker failed to load about 25% of the time until about 5 PM ET on Easter Eve, with residual issues after this time.
        <br><br>
        Despite the technical issues, you all came out once again in droves during peak hours, pushing the tracker beyond 100 hits a minute for almost 4 hours, peaking at 194 hits per minute. Once all was said and done, we landed with a final hit count of…
        <br><br>
        <h5>82,207</h5><br>
        82,207 hits from 1:59 AM EDT 4/8/23 - 6:01 AM EDT 4/9/23, calculated with the Geo API and our internal insights system. Overall, this represents 64.68% of the hits compared to last year's 127,093 hits, for the first year that the tracker has lost hits compared to the last. 
        <br><br>
        Nonetheless, we're still extremely proud of this hit count in spite of the technical issues this year, which almost certainly contributed to a lower hit count.
        <br><br>
        For the first year ever, we also monitored post-tracking hits. At this time, we can confirm that up to 7:45 PM EDT on 4/9, we gained an additional 14,000 hits to reach a total of 96,000 hits. We'll update this post with an exact number once 24 hours has elapsed since tracking ended.
        <br><br>
        This year was a tricky year technically. Throughout tracking we suffered from technical blips that were outside of the domain of the core tracker experience, notably having issues with the tracker failing to load at a high rate.
        <br><br>
        We'll post a detailed post-mortem out that describes why the tracker failed to load and went to a blank page from a technical standpoint soon. To summarize, up until about 5 PM EDT on Easter Eve, a misconfiguration made it so Cloudflare Web Analytics would not load on the tracker, resulting in the tracker being unable to load. This occurred at an incidence rate of ~25% up until 5 PM when we began to take actions and patch the issue out of the tracker, with residual failures following that.
        <br><br>
        In addition to the analytics issue, we had a few more technical blips. The Geo API was down for a bit just shortly after 5 AM EDT as we had to fix an issue with the insights page, resulting in estimated arrival times not being loaded (as the Geo API and internal insights run on the same server). At around 8 PM EDT, we had to mitigate an issue with a few actors spam reloading the tracker, which may have caused a few users to verify their browser to access the site. This issue was mitigated within about 10 minutes or so.
        <br><br>
        We're of course extremely disappointed these technical issues happened and we're already identifying ways to ensure that errors like these will be more carefully caught in testing.
        <br><br>
        Nonetheless, the tracker itself this year was extremely reliable and we're incredibly proud that we continue to provide a stable and reliable tracker (when it loads, of course). Whether you watched on YouTube or you weren't affected by loading issues, we were there for all 28 hours of the Easter Bunny's journey as the tracker operated without a hitch.
        <br><br>
        Despite some hiccups with Cloudflare, we once again relied on it for ensuring the tracker was super fast from anywhere on Earth. Cloudflare reported that throughout the course of tracking, 627,240 requests were received for a total data transfer of 31.02 GB. The new tracker ends up making less requests than last year's tracker so it isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison to last year's 1.65 million requests.
        <br><br>
        As always, let's dive into the stats of the tracker analytics from this year!
        <br><br>
        track.easterbunny.cc was visited from 93(!!) countries on Earth this year, but the top five for this year are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The United States came in first with 426,080 requests and traffic peaking at 9:45 PM EDT on April 8.</li>
          <li>The United Kingdom came in second with 56,870 requests and traffic peaking at 3:30 PM EDT on April 8.</li>
          <li>Canada came in third with 53,710 requests and traffic peaking at 8:30 PM EDT on April 8.</li>
          <li>Australia came in fourth with 51,460 requests and traffic peaking at 5:00 AM EDT on April 8.</li>
          <li>Ireland came in fifth with 18,770 requests and traffic peaking at 4:15 PM EDT on April 8.</li>
        </ul>
        Some other countries in our top ten this year:
        <ul>
          <li>South Africa came in sixth with 2,710 requests.</li>
          <li>New Zealand came in seventh with 2,490 requests.</li>
          <li>Brazil came in eighth with 1,740 requests.</li>
          <li>Chile came in ninth with 1,150 requests.</li>
          <li>Spain came in tenth with 1,070 requests.</li>
        </ul>
        All remaining countries came in at under 1,000 requests. <br><br>
        In terms of how you visited the tracker this year:
        <ul>
          <li>Safari and Chrome dominated the browser market this year. Safari posted a combined 311,260 requests from mobile & desktop versions. Chrome posted a combined 226,600 requests from mobile & desktop versions.</li>
          <li>iOS continued to be the most popular OS visiting the tracker with 288,040 requests this year. Android was a close second at 159,770 requests. And lastly was our desktop OSes, with Mac OS X reporting 67,640 requests, and Windows reporting 42,870 requests.</li>
          <li>Mobile devices continue to be where you all visit the tracker from, with 417,750 requests this year. Desktop devices posted 162,780 requests this year, for about a 2.56:1 ratio of mobile to desktop requests. Tablet users posted 46,700 requests.</li>
          <li>For source ISPs, Comcast once again led the way with 79,750 requests coming from them. AT&T Internet was a distant second at 46,060 requests. Verizon Wireless came in at third, with 38,110 requests.</li>
          <li>In terms of the most popular user agents, iPhones held the top spot for 3 out of 5 of them. The most popular user agent was an iPhone running iOS 16.3.1 with 94,500 requests, then iOS 16.1.1 in 2nd with 27,930 requests, and iOS 16.2 in 3rd with 25,580 requests. Fourth was a Mac running Safari 16.3 at 22,610 requests, then fifth was Windows 10+ running Chrome 111 at 17,750 requests.</li>
          <li>Lastly, the Cloudflare data center that handled the most requests was once again Chicago, logging 100,730 requests. The Newark data center was a close second at 88,610 requests, with the Washington DC data center logging 77,760 requests. The London, UK datacenter came in fourth this year with 53,750 requests.</li>
        </ul>
        Despite lower hit counts, over on YouTube the tracker continued to flourish with well over a dozen streams! At peak, there were over 1,000 people watching streams of track.easterbunny.cc with an estimate of about 40,000-50,000 playbacks once all was said and done. A big thank you to everyone who streamed the tracker this year, especially as folks were coming to YouTube in lieu of the tracker failing to load to keep up the Easter cheer.
        <br><br>
        One more thank you to folks who donated to the tracker (and on the stream we run)! Donations and ad revenue from that stream should cover about 10-15% of operating costs for this year. 
        <br><br>
        With stats aside, it's time to focus on what's coming next for our sixth run of TEBCC in 2024! The plan is to develop another major version of the tracker, Version 7, for 2024.
        <br><br>
        Version 7 will focus on finishing the transition over to React with all of our supporting pages in addition to the news page being hosted on a proper content management system. Past that, we're currently brainstorming new ideas for the tracker, all the way from small quality-of-life improvements to larger changes that change the core of the tracking experience.
        <br><br>
        We hope to have a post out in a few months detailing the development plan for v7 which will include a preliminary feature list for the year. As always, we want to make changes that enhance the tracking experience for the better, and aren't changes just for the sake of change.
        <br><br>
        Nonetheless, what is happening next weekend is the final run of our Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker (track.orthodoxbunny.cc). Be sure to check it out, tracking starts on Saturday, April 15, 2023 at 2 AM EDT if you haven't gotten enough of that tracking fix just yet.
        <br><br>
        And with the v6 run over, work will begin very shortly on getting the v6 code open-sourced! If you don't know, the tracker is open-source and has been for the last two or so years. We'll be working on getting all the documentation written and are hoping to get the code out sometime in late April/early May 2023.
        <br><br>
        The Easter Bunny is back at home and taking a well-deserved rest after delivering 6.120 billion baskets, snacking on 55.413 million carrots, and traveling 299,458 miles (481,931 km) over the course of a 25-hour journey that spanned the globe. And after the rollercoaster of tracking, we're also ready for a rest as well.
        <br><br>
        The tracker will stay online until April 14, 2023 (not April 23 as indicated in the FAQ) before resetting to the countdown for 2024. Take some time to explore the map to see where the Easter Bunny visited, there's just shy of 1,000 locations to explore! And be sure to click on baskets as well to see information about each stop and to learn something new!
        <br><br>
        As other trackers did...well frankly nothing for 2023, we once again pushed the bar another year ahead of the rest to make an Easter Bunny tracking experience like no other. With a new UI, stop arrival animations, improved pre-tracking, better localization support, precise arrival estimates, native fullscreen and more, Version 6 was a testament that five years later, our pace of innovation hasn't let up at all.
        <br><br>
        We cannot wait to surprise you once again in 2024 with awesome new features in the tracker and better reliability so everyone can experience the amazing features we have to offer.
        <br><br>
        Thank you all once again for a super successful (if a bit bumpy) fifth year of tracking, and we can't wait for the sixth!
        <br><br>
        Happy Easter to you and your family,

      </p>
      <p>
        A couple days ago, we said the famous words "this will likely be the last release of the tracker". That was a lie. track.easterbunny.cc Version 6.1.5 is here with a few bug fixes just to make the tracking experience as perfect as possible. Here's the full changelog!
        <ul>
          <li>Improved the smoothness of the map zooming in/out on stop departure/arrival when smoother settings are being used. This will result in map smoothness being temporarily slower for the second after departure (only if zooming into stops is enabled).</li>
          <li>Introduced a new nudge for the distance from you metric. When you first switch to the metric and approximate location is being used (by default), you'll receive an alert informing you that you can visit settings to improve the precision of the metric.</li>
          <li>Updated our internal metric systems to ensure hits are getting counted as accurately as possible.</li>
          <li>Fixed a couple issues in the FAQ page.</li>
        </ul>
        Anyway, we're super excited to get tracking going in just about 3 days time. <br><br>
        Update (April 5, 2023): A couple patches have been released to the tracker today. Look for a new commit SHA next to the version number to ensure you're using the latest version of the tracker!

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello all! track.easterbunny.cc Version 6.1.4 has been released today with some major performance updates. During late-stage tracker testing, we discovered that the tracker had a couple areas where things were performing slower compared to v5.6, so this patch gets all that sorted out. It's important to note these performance changes won't affect things with the countdown but are more geared towards when tracking starts. Without further ado, let's get into the changelog.
        <ul>
          <li>The Google Maps API is now loaded simultaneously with the tracker. This should hopefully improve loading times on slower devices or slower connections since things are being simultaneously fetched.</li>
          <li>Removed the arrival time of a stop when hovering over a basket icon on the map. We discovered that rendering the arrival time was about 70% of the time spent when placing a basket on the map, so it's been removed. Usually in this case we'd add a setting that allows you to toggle this setting back on (if you did enjoy arrival times when hovering over), however given we're less than a week from liftoff this will be a feature for next year, especially as we'd want to have a good UX experience.</li>
          <li>Made huge performance improvements with how the tracker catches back up when you leave it alone for a while (e.g. if your device goes to sleep). Our preliminary testing shows the tracker catches back up about 600-800% faster than it previously did.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where if you left the tracker alone from the countdown phase then it moved into the tracking phase, double baskets would be placed for each stop which could negatively impact performance. We've added safeguards to ensure this cannot happen.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where if you left the tracker alone from the countdown phase then it moved to the tracking phase, the countdown would briefly show a negative number. We have updated the behavior so it cannot do this.</li>
          <li>Added browser locale information to the diagnostic information in settings.</li>
          <li>Fixed a couple minor bugs in the tracker.</li>
        </ul>
        TEBCC v6 has been a huge upgrade and we've been doing our utmost to ensure a bug-free, high-performance experience. This will likely be the last release of the tracker unless additional bugs prompt us to release another tracker version. We hope you're very excited to start tracking in less than a week on April 8, 2023. See you then!

      <p>
        Some exciting news for you today! Yesterday, Apple released Safari 16.4 alongside iPadOS 16.4 and macOS Ventura 13.3, which finally enables support for the native fullscreen API that our fullscreen button uses. <br><br>
        This means if you upgrade to the latest OS/Safari versions, the fullscreen button will appear on the bottom left of the tracker. It's super exciting to finally have support for fullscreen and we hope you use it. <br><br>
        Just a few quick notes with this feature. First, this will not work on iOS 16.4 unfortunately as Apple continues to not allow browser fullscreen on iPhones. Second, on iPad you will notice that the last stop/next stop box gets somewhat obstructed by the close fullscreen button. If this is annoying, you can head to the tracker tab of settings and enable nudging down the top boxes which does exactly that! Third and last, this feature is only available on Safari on iPadOS 16.4 and not on any other browsers. <br><br>
        Give this feature a try! And we hope you're ready for tracking starting in just 10 days.

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello all! track.easterbunny.cc has been upgraded to Version 6.1.3 with some bug fixes as we continue to count the days down to liftoff. Without further ado, let's get straight into the changelog.
        <ul>
          <li>The local arrival in stop information window setting is now hidden on devices that aren't compatible with this feature.</li>
          <li>Improved accuracy of the stop information database, including more consistent formatting in stop descriptions.</li>
          <li>The donate window has been redone with an embedded Ko-fi widget. You can now donate to the tracker without leaving it!</li>
          <li>Slight improvements to stop accuracy as we continue to refine our systems for this year.</li>
          <li>Other small changes and fixes to the tracker.</li>
        </ul>
        With just 15 days to go until liftoff, v6.1.3 likely represents the last tracker release before things get going unless more bugs are found. Nonetheless, we are confident that our tracker is ready for this year after lots and lots of testing. In the mean time, we're extensively testing our supporting systems before tracking begins. <br><br>
        That's all for v6.1.3! <br><br>
        Update (March 28, 2023): v6.1.3 has been patched with a couple bug fixes as of today. These fixes aren't enough to warrant a full v6.1.4 release of the tracker however.

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello everyone! track.easterbunny.cc Version 6.1.2 has been released as we continue to refine the tracker before liftoff. This release features one new feature and plenty of bug fixes. Here's what's new!<br><br>
        <b>Nudge top boxes in fullscreen</b><br>
        In preparation for the release of iPadOS 16.4 (which unlocks the fullscreen ability in the tracker), we've introduced a feature to help get the most out of this experience. When in fullscreen on iPadOS 16.4, there is a button to exit fullscreen which blocks some of the top boxes. We've added a new setting in the tracker tab which allows you to nudge down the top boxes so the exit fullscreen button doesn't block the buttons. This is an optional feature and is off by default. Similar to the Chrome map fix setting, it'll only show up on iPadOS 16.4 browsers.
        <br><br>
        <b>Bug fixes & other improvements:</b><br>
        As always we've been busy making lots of small changes and improvements. Here's the full list of these fixes.
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a bug where updating your precise location by clicking on precise location wouldn't update arrival time estimates/distance from you metric.</li>
          <li>Fixed bugs with the browser detection for fullscreen capabilities.</li>
          <li>Switched to a feature-based browser detection system.</li>
          <li>Removed showing when pre-tracking & tracking ends in the about modal.</li>
          <li>Added return to tracker/FAQ links in most supporting pages at the top of the page.</li>
          <li>Refined stop accuracy systems.</li>
        </ul>
        This is a pretty small release compared to v6.1.1 as the tracker code is beginning to freeze so we can ensure stability. We've also been hard at work updating and testing our other systems that supplement the tracking experience. <br><br>
        Just 21 days to go until tracking begins. We're getting close!

          <li>Depending on your region, Localisation is used as the title for that tab.</li>
          <li>Horizontal shift behavior has been updated with more precision based on your screen height.</li>
          <li>Fixed issues with you rapidly switched between precise & approximate location in localization settings.</li>
          <li>Fixed a minor formatting issue with times in the tracker.</li>
          <li>Added an explanation about the fullscreen button in the about modal.</li>
          <li>Added a fade animation to the status text in the precise location feature.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue when settings were reset to default, the current location being depicted was not accurate in the your location accuracy setting.</li>
          <li>Improved browser compatibility with older browsers.</li>

          <li>And of course, fixed lots of smaller bugs in the tracker.</li>
        </ul>
        Hopefully you'll notice these small changes in the tracker, and all of these come together to really refine Version 6.1 and the rest of the tracker. As always, we're continuing to test our brand new tracker before launch and ironing out any bugs. <br><br>
        With 28 days until liftoff, expect another bug fix release or two before we get tracking underway (but no major feature releases). Enjoy v6.1.1!

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello everyone! Today I'm happy to announce that track.easterbunny.cc has been upgraded to Version 6.1 with lots of exciting changes. These changes (and bug fixes as always) will help make the tracker the best that it can be. Let's jump into the changes! <br><br>
        <b>New localization tab in settings</b><br>
        Version 6.1 contains lots of changes that relate to localizing the tracker to your specific liking. As such, we've introduced a sixth tab in settings that helps you localize the trackers settings to your liking. As a result of this change, the tracker units setting has moved over to this tab, and can no longer be found in the settings tab. But, let's get into what's in this tab! <br><br>
        <b>Support for changing time units in the tracker</b><br>
        Browsers are notoriously bad at detecting which clock style your device is in. As such, we've now introduced the ability to manually change whether times in the tracker are presented in 12 or 24-hour formats! Similar to the tracker units setting, there's an automatic selection by default, which defaults to the preferred clock style of your locale. There's two manual settings that come after that, 12-hour and 24-hour. These changes apply to the times listed in the stop information modal, and when hovering over basket icons on desktop devices.<br><br>
        <b>Precise location support!</b><br>
        This has been a feature that I've long wanted to introduce and it's finally here! We've always used an approximate way of determining where you are to figure out when the Easter Bunny arrives and how far the Easter Bunny is from you using your IP address. We did this because otherwise the tracker would have to request your location on load, and that's a little suspicious to do! Most of the time, this estimate is decently accurate and pinpoints your general whereabouts. However, we've also known on mobile data that sometimes the location is wrong, and for some ISPs your estimated location just isn't quite right. <br><br>
        That's where precise location comes in. In the localization tab, you can now tell the tracker to query your current location for arrival estimates and a precise distance from you metric. Doing so also unlocks some added benefits in the tracker! Namely, the estimated arrival time will become loads more accurate, updating in quarter hour intervals throughout tracking. When the Easter Bunny is around the corner, you'll get estimates at 45, 30, 20, 10 and less than 10 minutes before arrival. And when the Easter Bunny is nearby, you'll be able to see down-to-the-stop when the Easter Bunny arrives, up to 10 stops before arrival (of course this is your warning to get tucked in bed so the Easter Bunny can deliver your baskets!). With this update, if you're using approximate location, the distance from you metric now updates in 10 mile or kilometer intervals, and you'll need to enable precise location to unlock its full accuracy. <br><br>
        As always, there's a couple notes for this update. Precise location doesn't require a GPS-capable device, you'll be able to use it on Wi-Fi devices as well. Additionally, the tracker won't try to get your precise location after you query it, so it's up to you to click on Precise location again to update your location if you're on the move. Lastly, to conserve resources (as we need to make reverse geocode calls to provide feedback that we found your location correctly), you'll be limited to updating your precise location at most every 30 minutes. <br><br>
        We're pretty excited for this feature to finally hit the tracker, and we can't wait for you to explore it. You can activate it now in the countdown page before tracking begins!<br><br>
        <b>Improved local timezone formatting</b><br>
        Due to the switch from Moment.js to Luxon (and therefore relying on your browser's locale data), we found an issue with the local arrival time where timezone abbreviations weren't always showing. This is no longer the case! <br><br>
        For about ~50-60% of stops, you should be able to see an abbreviation. For about ~20-30% of stops, you'll see a GMT/UTC offset. There's some stops that will show their timezone as it's intended to be formatted locally, so don't fret if you see odd characters in that field. <br><br>
        Nonetheless, this hopefully brings this feature closer to how it operated in v5.6 of the tracker.<br><br>
        <b>Bug fixes!</b><br>
        As with every release of the tracker, we're always working hard on bug fixes. Here's all the bugs that have been fixed in the tracker for this release:
        <ul>
          <li>Updated the behavior of the donation banner, it now shows up with a 50% chance, after 2 minutes of usage, and shows up for 15 seconds.</li>
          <li>Updated the text of the donate modal and the donation banner.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue with the buttons blocking interactable area with the map.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue when the Easter Bunny would depart a stop, parts of the Next Stop box would update asynchronously. It now updates synchronously.</li>
          <li>All stops now refer to Turkey as Türkiye, as this is how it's now depicted on Google Maps.</li>
          <li>Updated some text for certain settings</li>
          <li>Continued to improve stop accuracy!</li>
          <li>Added a persistent warning to settings if the Geo API could not be queried when the tracker loads</li>
          <li>The Geo API is now called every time the tracker is loaded</li>
        </ul>
        And that's Version 6.1 of track.easterbunny.cc. With one month left until tracking, expect some additional bug fixes to come out as we continue to test our tracker and make changes for the best possible experience.

      <hr class="styledhr" id="pid-111">
      <p class="lead">Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 6!</p>
      <p>Posted: February 20, 2023 <br>
        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('111'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-111" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-111</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 6 - it's finally here! After a hiatus of releasing new features last year, we're back for 2023 with a completely rebuilt tracker with a completely new design, new features, and lots of bug fixes. Let's get straight into the changelog!
        <br><br>
        <b>A brand new tracker from the ground up!</b><br>
        For the last 4 years, our tracker ran on a mix of Material Design Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and lots of spaghetti code. For 2023, we've completely refactored the tracker into React with Material Design Bootstrap 5.
        <br><br>
        This refactor sets the path for a much more maintainable tracker going forward, and will allow us to introduce lots of new features in the coming years.
        <br><br>
        You'll notice that the design of the tracker is much more modern with rounded corners, more readable text, smoother animations, and small UI tweaks across the tracker to optimize for the user experience. At the same time, we've kept the design language that our tracker has had for five years now, just 3 boxes at the top. We can't wait for you to experience this new redesign!
        <br><br>
        You'll also notice that our supporting pages (such as the FAQ & news page) are still using Material Design Bootstrap 4. This was an intentional choice, and we plan on switching them over to React as part of Version 7 coming in 2024.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Easter Bunny arrives at stops!</b><br>
        In what is probably the coolest feature this year, we're now depicting the Easter Bunny arriving at stops! When the Easter Bunny reaches a stop, the map will zoom in, the icon will change to one depicting the Easter Bunny dropping off baskets, zoom out, and repeat this for every stop. This feature works similarly to what Google's Santa Tracker does with a couple changes.
        <br><br>
        In order to preserve our legendary stop accuracy, the Easter Bunny stops in a city for about 5-30 seconds (depending on how big the city is and how long there are between stops), then moves on to the next stop. This lower stoppage time (compared to Google who does 60 seconds for all stops) meant we were able to keep every stop from last year, and also means a faster paced tracker!
        <br><br>
        There's a few important notes with this feature. With the introduction of stop arrivals, the map will automatically zoom into and out to whatever your default zoom level setting is, so it's crucial you set this up correctly if you enjoy a more zoomed in (or zoomed out) map. You can find the configuration for this in the Map section of settings.
        <br><br>
        If you don't like the map zooming in and out, that's fine! We've also added a setting that allows you to disable the zoom animation entirely. Disabling the animation also means the map won't zoom in/out automatically, so you can choose a zoom manually (either by the buttons or with your mouse wheel).
        <br><br>
        <b>Vastly improved pre-tracking!</b><br>
        For the past few years, pre-tracking has had updates every 5 minutes from Easter Island, with faster updates in the final 15 minutes before tracking begins. We're proud to say that we're improving this experience by having updates every 2.5 minutes! These faster updates mean that you'll be able to get a closer peek at the preparations undertaken on Easter Island before the Easter Bunny lifts off.
        <br><br>
        <b>Much improved settings experience!</b><br>
        We've made loads of improvements to the settings experience this year, making it easier to customize tracker settings to your likings.
        <br><br>
        First and foremost is the general layout of the settings window - it's now wider on desktop devices, and the tabs for each section on mobile devices are smaller, so it's easier to scroll down to the actual settings!
        <br><br>
        We've overhauled the tracker smoothness settings, allowing you to hover over each setting to see how fast metrics will update. We've also increased the default smoothness setting to 5 FPS for the map and 10 FPS for the tracker (if you were using default settings last year, you'll be migrated to using the smoother default smoothness). And lastly, we now feature 5 smoothness levels for your choosing.
        <br><br>
        The default zoom level setting now features a slider bar so that it's way easier to change your default zoom level. We also include handy text to tell you what the zoom level will be when the Easter Bunny arrives at stops.
        <br><br>
        This year, we added a help menu to settings in case you have some questions with the tracker. There's quick links to where you can find support (along with a link to Known Issues), some tips on how to best stream the tracker, and diagnostic information in case you ask us for support.
        <br><br>
        We've made some updates to our default settings - the stream optimized settings now reflect what settings most streams used in 2022, there's new low performance defaults for older devices, and you'll also be able to set the tracker settings to make the tracker look like it was back in 2019.
        <br><br>
        And last but not least, the entire settings window is using the new design framework we're using, and it looks SO MUCH better compared to the settings window of prior years.
        <br><br>
        <b>Native fullscreen button!</b><br>
        Have you ever wanted the tracker to go fullscreen but just couldn't find where the fullscreen button is in your browser? Or maybe it still showed the URL bar? We've got a solution for you.
        <br><br>
        On the stack of buttons in the bottom left of the tracker, you'll see a new button this year - a handy dandy button to make the tracker go fullscreen without tabs, URL bars, anything, it's truly fullscreen! And once you're done immersing yourself in Easter Bunny Tracking the way it was meant to be, you can click that button again to exit fullscreen mode.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, not all browsers support our code directly controlling fullscreen, so this feature is only available on compatible browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and a few others). Most notably, Safari and all iOS/iPadOS devices are missing, due to complications Apple introduces in WebKit that we couldn't get around. We're hoping to expand support in v7 as this feature is in beta right now.
        <br><br>
        If you don't see the fullscreen icon in your favorite browser - let us know, and we can try to add in support!
        <br><br>
        (Note: If Safari 16.4 is released before the tracker launches, we will patch in support as Apple is changing how fullscreen is being handled in 16.4!)
        <br><br>
        <b>Improved stop detection!</b><br>
        Every year we try really hard to keep improving our stop detection. And this year is no different. We've improved coverage in the Eastern US, Australia, Japan, China, and India for this year, in addition to a variety of improvements across the globe. In total, we expect to detect just shy of 1,000 stops this year.
        <br><br>
        We've also made changes to the intervals that stops happen at. Previously, stops happened precisely on the minute, but this year you'll notice that some arrival times won't occur on the minute. You'll see this change in various places around the globe as we've switched to depicting 90 seconds between stops sometimes.
        <br><br>
        In the United States, you'll see a new experimental type of stop detection with sub-minute intervals between stops. This is what's powering us to detect even more stops in the United States. We're only trying this feature out in the US (along with a couple other places globally) as we try to find new ways to get the best geographic coverage of any tracker online.
        <br><br>
        <b>Still no ads in the tracker?</b><br>
        Contrary to previous communications, ads will not be a part of Version 6 of track.easterbunny.cc. Unfortunately, given the limited development time and delays when putting ads in the tracker, we were unable to create the best ad-supported experience that we could. Therefore, ads won't be in the tracker this year.
        <br><br>
        As a compromise, you may see a banner asking you to donate when you use the tracker. We'd really appreciate it if you could donate to the tracker, if just 1% of our users donated $1, we'd cover all of our costs for tracking and could keep the tracker ad-free (this sounds like a Wikipedia ad, but it's true!).
        <br><br>
        We're hoping that these banners and an updated donate window can raise awareness about the importance of supporting the tracker so we can keep tracking the Easter Bunny without ads.
        <br><br>
        <b>The last hurrah for track.orthodoxbunny.cc</b><br>
        Although all these changes are exciting for track.easterbunny.cc, unfortunately, our sister site track.orthodoxbunny.cc will be tracking for the last time this Orthodox Easter.
        <br><br>
        Low usage combined with high infrastructure demands in the wake of TEBCC runs mean that it no longer makes sense to run the tracker in the future. You can read more information about the shutdown over at track.orthodoxbunny.cc.
        <br><br>
        <b>Open-source revival!</b><br>
        With all this new code, we're happy to say that we will update our open-source codebases with the new tracker in May 2023. We will also use a less restrictive license this year - information about which one specifically will be announced when the v6 codebase is open-sourced.
        <br><br>
        We hope that the much cleaner code (seriously, it's a huge improvement) will allow users to take the work we've done and transform it into a lot of cool trackers!
        <br><br>
        <b>Other changes and fixes:</b><br>
        Of course, we make a lot of little changes from year to year, so here's a full list of these changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Settings will migrate from v5 to v6 with zero touches</li>
          <li>Tracker will reload automatically before tracking to ensure the most accurate data if you've had it open for a while</li>
          <li>Chrome browsers are getting detected much more reliably for the chrome map fix feature</li>
          <li>Default zoom level feature has been restricted to 11 from 14, if your setting was 12 or higher it'll come down to 11 automatically</li>
          <li>Default streamer settings updated with what most people used in 2022</li>
          <li>Switched to Apple Weather for weather data from Dark Sky</li>
          <li>Automatic redirects on the incompatible browser & JS disabled pages if your browser is compatible or JS is enabled</li>
          <li>Fixed button styling in the news page</li>
          <li>Privacy Policy has been updated to further clarify how we collect analytics on tracker usage</li>
          <li>Acknowledgements page has been rewritten as we're using new libraries this year</li>
          <li>FAQ page has been updated to account for the latest tracker features</li>
          <li>Back & forward buttons are now being used to switch metrics in the metrics box (instead of a one-way button)</li>
          <li>Three boxes are now only visible with a 992px or higher viewport width (compared to 768px last year)</li>
          <li>Low height map shift now starts at a 550px viewport height compared to 500px last year. We also added new cutoffs for displays under 300px viewport heights.</li>
          <li>Second precision is shown for the arrival time in extended stop data if the stop does not occur on the minute (or the surrounding stops aren't on the minute)</li>
          <li>Known issues page has been rewritten and is now directly linked in the tracker</li>
          <li>A warning will now appear if the tracker loads and the Geo API cannot be loaded</li>
          <li>The tracker now has a loading bar to show you the progress of syncing tracker data. It will also detect errors with timeouts/network connectivity/request aborts</li>
          <li>Our hit insights system now tracks hits up to 24 hours after tracking ends. We saw considerable traffic once tracking ended last year and want to key into these insights. This will also allow us to factor in hits post-tracking in our estimates.</li>
          <li>A lot of small fixes to make things even better!</li>
        </ul>
        And that's track.easterbunny.cc Version 6! It's a huge leap from Version 5 & 5.6. We're hopeful that all these new changes only improve the Easter Bunny tracking experience as we continue on our journey to build the best Easter Bunny Tracker on the web. As there's about a month until tracking begins, you'll definitely be seeing some bug fixes and maybe an improvement here or there to ensure the tracker is ready to go - stay tuned!
        <br><br>
        Of course, Version 6 is only the beginning of some big changes coming to the tracker, and we're not planning on stopping our relentless pace of innovations anytime soon.
        <br><br>
        Pre-tracking gets underway on April 8, 2023 at 2 AM EDT, with tracking beginning three hours later on April 8, 2023 at 5 AM EDT. Tracking ends 25 hours later on April 9, 2023 at 6 AM EDT, and the map will stay up for about a week or so. We're excited to get tracking and hope you can join us!

      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the first development update for track.easterbunny.cc Version 6! As mentioned in our last post, v6 is a complete redo of the tracker and we've already made lots of progress to date. Without further ado, let's get into this development update.
        <br><br>
        <b>What's complete</b><br>
        In short - about 90% of the new React tracker. This is a huge milestone in just 3-4 weeks since we started development. We're now largely transitioning away from implementing new features and onto QA and bug testing the new tracker, in addition to ensuring the tracker can also support the legacy info pages as they won't be transitioned to React this year. We're hoping we can be exclusively QA testing the new tracker by February 1st and we're on track to hit this mark.
        <br><br>
        The new React tracker officially has feature-parity with the existing v5.6 tracker and we're past the point of no return in using this tracker for 2023. This is super exciting news and we cannot wait to share with you the new tracker!
        <br><br>
        <b>What's left to go</b><br>
        In short - still quite a lot! While the tracker may be almost done, there's still quite a lot to do in everything supporting the tracker. There's a lot in the queue here, including getting AdSense up and running, ensuring the Geo API & internal analytics are updated for the new tracker, the Twitter bot being ready to rumble, and the yearly updates of our stop information databases to ensure everything in the tracker is up to date. We're hoping to hit this mark by March 1st for all infrastructure to be ready by then.
        <br><br>
        There's also converting our weather data provider from Dark Sky to Apple Weather in the coming months due to the Dark Sky API shutting down soon. And given this transition has to occur in multiple projects outside of TEBCC, we're leaving an entire month for this conversion - April 1st is the expected finish date here.
        <br><br>
        <b>What's new in TEBCC v6</b><br>
        As we look closer to finishing the tracker for this year, I wanted to make a preliminary list of what the changes coming to TEBCC v6 are. While this is not a year for huge feature improvements, there are some nice changes compared to v5.6 that you'll most certainly enjoy.
        <ul>
          <li>Refined Material Design UI - we're now using Material Design Bootstrap v5. Expect a cleaner design with more rounded corners, larger text & buttons, a redone left button layout, and some general tweaks and improvements across the board to really refine the UI/UX experience.</li>
          <li>Countdown, Pre-Tracking, and Tracking under one roof - This has been a dream since 2019 and it's finally coming true, the entire tracker will be at one URL and will seamlessly transfer between the different states of tracking with zero redirects.</li>
          <li>The Easter Bunny now arrives at stops! - Another really cool feature coming to the tracker that takes inspiration from the Google Santa Tracker. Having the Easter Bunny arrive at stops makes the tracker all the more engaging, especially as the tracker will automatically zoom into and out of stops on arrival and departure. However, unlike in GST, these arrivals are depicted for about 5-20 seconds (depending on city population and time between stops) before the Easter Bunny moves onto the next stop. Doing this allows us to keep the tracker fast-paced and retain our world-class stop detection. We also have the option to turn off the map zoom in/out for users who don't like it, or for folks timelapsing the tracker.</li>
          <li>Automatic setting migration from v5.6 - Whatever settings you had for v5 of the tracker will automatically migrate over to v6 of the tracker. The only change is that the default zoom level setting range is now 0-11, instead of 0-14 (if you set it between 12-14, it'll drop back to 11).</li>
        </ul>
        With that, there's just 78 days until liftoff (and even less until the launch of Version 6 on April 1!) and that will conclude this development update. Another development update will be out in a couple weeks, so see you then!

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello! It's Owen here. As I embark on preparations for our fifth run of the tracker, I've got some news about Version 6 of track.easterbunny.cc and the future of the tracker. <br><br>
        Since the first run in 2019, I could've never imagined how far TEBCC would go in 4 short years. From the tracker's modest beginnings with just a few thousand hits in our first year to now two back-to-back runs that've exceeded 100,000 hits, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for believing in me, believing in my tracker, and using it during Easter! My mission has always been to develop a feature-rich, world-class Easter Bunny Tracker (that's starting to rival the resident Santa Trackers), and I think it's safe to say that this mission has come to fruition. Running the world's second most popular Easter Bunny Tracker has meant I've been able to learn so much about web development, infrastructure, SEO, social media management and more throughout the last four years. It has truly been an honor to do all this learning in such a unique and awesome way with TEBCC.<br><br>
        But as the fifth year of tracking rolls around, the thing that the tracker is built on is showing its age - the codebase. To be frank, I've learned quite a lot about web development since 2019 which include good and bad practices, and in general new frameworks as well. And while TEBCC has been a great learning platform, it's also rooted in my 2019 knowledge. This means the tracker's core logic sits inside of a script tag in a HTML file that's over 3,000 lines long, long chunks of code are reused multiple times in multiple files, it's just generally quite a mess and adding any feature has a ton of technical baggage attached.<br><br>
        The trackers codebase has gotten to a point where I need to refactor it to continue to provide quality support, updates, and as a foundation for features coming in the future. So for 2023, I'm completely redoing the tracker in React, and rebuilding it from the ground up. I'll also be completely ripping up and redoing a lot of the infrastructure TEBCC lies on as well. <br><br>
        This year will be similar to v5.6 in terms of features (translation: no ground-breaking features), as literally the entire tracker has to be redone in about 3 months time. The current features coming to the tracker are a reskinned yet familiar UI (using Material Bootstrap 5), a single page for countdown, pre-tracking and tracking (finally!), the Easter Bunny stopping at each stop (in a similar fashion to Google), and of course some smaller changes that'll come up during development. The scope of the refactor before April 2023 will be limited to just the tracker - I'm unfortunately a college student with a part-time job so there's only so much I can code, and this is what I believe can be done in the next 3 months. I also have to deal with the impending shutdown of the Dark Sky API in other projects of mine (including TEBCC), so that sadly eats into dev time. <br><br>
        What's exciting are the changes beyond 2023 and into 2024 that refactoring the tracker affords us. After April 2023, I'll get back to work and refactor the rest of the tracker, and then start the fun of new major features! Some ideas on the table are a complete rethinking of the entire tracker UI, adding 3D maps (a highly requested feature since 2019), live Easter Bunny updates throughout tracking, and lots more to come. You'll likely see updates coming out for the tracker through Summer and Fall 2023! <br><br>
        Another important update for this year is that for the first time, the tracker will have to be ad supported. While I would love to keep the tracker ad-free and I am immensely grateful for all who donated to the tracker, unfortunately donations covered less than 5% of operating costs last year. As the tracker surges in popularity, I'm expecting operating costs to exceed $1,000, so ads it is. I'll do my best to keep them as non-intrusive as possible. If you do visit the tracker with an adblocker on, I totally understand (and I hate ads myself), but please consider donating. I am not a mega corporation with unlimited money unfortunately! <br><br>
        One last update on track.orthodoxbunny.cc - it's clear that with my limited bandwidth to work on personal projects as I get older, I need to condense and filter which projects make sense to keep alive. track.orthodoxbunny.cc is sadly one that will have to get the chopping block. TOBCC, while a cool experiment, has not taken off in the same way as TEBCC, only receiving ~1-2% of the traffic that TEBCC does. Given that TOBCC has to have basically a duplicate of TEBCC's infrastructure and be set up in the span of 5-6 days after TEBCC runs, it's a lot of work in a time where I'm already busy with post-TEBCC-run activities. So, 2023 will be TOBCC's last year online and it will run on the v5.6 codebase. An official annonucement will be made on the TOBCC website in March. <br><br>
        Anyway, that's all for now. I'm hoping for the refactored tracker to launch on April 1, 2023. Have a happy new year, let's make 2023 amazing for TEBCC!

        The countdown is on for 2023 - and that means the tracker has returned to the countdown state for next year. Thank you all once again for the wonderful support this year. We've got lots of exciting changes scheduled for 2023, so stay tuned!

        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('100'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-100" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-100</a>

      <p>
        Easter 2022 - our fourth year of operations. Last year, we had managed to crest over 100,000 hits, cementing ourselves as the 2nd most popular tracker. But would it happen again? Would we see the same peak as last year?<br><br>
        As 200 people were with us from the transition from the countdown to pre-tracking, and as we estimated about 130% growth over the year, this was no fluke. Then, the peak of traffic came once again. Last year, you all pushed the tracker to a maximum of 200 hits per minute and held it there for an hour and a half.<br><br>
        This year - you pushed the tracker up to 265 hits per minute (an eye-watering 4.42 hits/second). And you kept the tracker over 200 hits a minute for double the duration - three hours.<br><br>
        All of this meant that by the end of tracking, as calculated with our new insights system and through the Geo API, we had a total hit count of...<br><br>
        <h5>127,093</h5><br>
        127,093 hits from 1:59 AM EDT 4/16 - 6:01 AM EDT 4/17. A 124% Year-On-Year growth from 2021, adding about 24,900 hits to the count. While the slowest growth in our four years of operation, we're still very proud of this number.<br><br>
        Now, last year, we claimed that the tracker had grown a whopping 26,500% percent compared to 2019. What we didn't realize is that our math was plain wrong, and that should've been 2,650% (26,500% percent growth would mean we managed to hit 1 million hits). So, corrected, we've grown 3,177% since our launch in 2019. I think we were a little too excited last year.<br><br>
        What this does mean is that, on average, for every 52.8 minutes in 2022, we received the same amount of traffic that we did in 28 hours in 2019.<br><br>
        Throughout tracking, we were there alongside the Easter Bunny for 28 hours as our site operated without a hitch. CloudFlare was once again immensely helpful to keep our site alive and healthy, with a 99%+ cache rate throughout the course of tracking (we really think the uncached requests were just to the Geo API).<br><br>
        CloudFlare reported that an immense 1.65 million requests were made to the tracker - for a total of 25.24 GB of data transferred.<br><br>
        track.easterbunny.cc was visited from approximately 95 countries this year, but our top 5 countries are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The United States came in 1st with an eye-watering 1.05 million requests, and traffic peaking at 10 PM EDT on April 16.</li>
          <li>Canada came in 2nd with 201,180 requests, and traffic peaking at 9 PM EDT on April 16.</li>
          <li>The United Kingdom came in 3rd with 145,690 requests, and traffic peaking at 3:45 PM EDT on April 16.</li>
          <li>Australia came in a very close 4th with 137,680 requests, and traffic peaking at 6:45 AM EDT on April 16. Australia managed to lead the way with traffic from the start of tracking all the way to 8:15 AM EDT on April 16.</li>
          <li>Ireland came in 5th with 71,340 requests, and peaked with traffic at 4:30 PM EDT on April 16.</li>
        </ul>
      All remaining countries had under 10,000 requests.<br><br>
      We love sharing stats, so here's some more!
      <ul>
        <li>Safari posted the highest browser use this year - a combined 781,950 requests from mobile and desktop safari. Chrome came in second - a combined 650,890 requests from mobile and desktop Chrome.</li>
        <li>iOS led the way in OS use, coming in with 743,180 requests. Android was a close second, at 506,250 requests. For most of tracking, iOS and Android posted relatively equal shares, until the United States began to drive traffic on iOS devices making a relatively large difference.</li>
        <li>Mobile devices outshined desktop devices three-to-one, with 1.14 million requests to 379,790 requests.</li>
        <li>Comcast posted the most requests as an ASN (internet provider), with 208,380 requests. AT&T internet was a distant second with 89,450 requests, with Verizon Wireless in third at 88,120 requests.</li>
        <li>The most popular user agent was an iPhone running iOS 15.4.1, with 208,630 requests. The second most popular user agent was also an iPhone, but running iOS 15.3.1 at 188,200 requests. The third most popular user agent was, you guessed, an iPhone, running iOS 14.8.1 at 41,610 requests.</li>
        <li>The Chicago Cloudflare data center was responsible for handling the most requests - 341,290 of them. Newark was a close second at 239,130 requests.</li>
      </ul>
      With stats aside - it's time to focus on the future of track.easterbunny.cc. This year, we added a donation button and enabled monetization on our (mostly official) live stream. While we thank those who donated, unfortunately, the donations and monetization will likely cover under 10% of our map bill this year (which is sitting at over $700!).<br><br>
      This means that beginning with Version 6 of track.easterbunny.cc, ads will likely have to be placed on the tracker. As much as this pains me to say, it's a necessary action we'll have to take. More information about how we'll handle ads on the website will come at a later date.<br><br>
      Nonetheless - there's a lot to look forward to with Version 6. We've been fundamentally using the same frameworks, design, and underlying code for the fourth year running, and as much as we love our code, it's time for a change.<br><br>
      Over the next year, we'll be refactoring the tracker into a modern framework with modern design. And while we're at it, we'll be rethinking what Easter Bunny Tracking can be, with an experience to hopefully wow you. And we promise we'll get it done.<br><br>
      In the meantime, if you still have that knack for Easter Bunny tracking, our sister site, track.orthodoxbunny.cc, will be up and running on Saturday, April 23 tracking the Easter Bunny's Orthodox Easter journey.<br><br>
      As the Easter Bunny now rests from an incredibly long journey after delivering 5.674 billion baskets, eating 47.449 million carrots, and travelling 292,000 mi, we're ready for our rest as well. The tracker will stay online until April 24, before resetting to the countdown for 2022. Take some time to explore the map and see where the Easter Bunny visited - there's about 900 locations to explore!<br><br>
      We're so excited to see what's in store in 2023, and we can't wait. Thank you all once again for an incredibly successful fourth year of tracking. <br><br>
      Happy Easter to you and your family, <br>

      <p class="lead">track.easterbunny.cc upgraded to v5.6.1</p>
      <p>Posted: April 11, 2022 <br>
        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('97'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-97" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-97</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello! Today we're announcing track.easterbunny.cc v5.6.1, with some refinements and other improvements right before tracking. Without further ado, here's whats new.<br><br>
        <b>Overhauled horizontal shift system</b><br>
        The system that controls horizontal shifting has been rewritten. It now works anywhere that has a height of 500px or less as determined by your browser, rather just when your orientation changes. It'll also work when you change the height of your window, which it previously didn't. Lastly - it'll also work in portrait mode for very small screens (e.g. 4-inch iOS devices)!<br><br>
        <b>Box reshuffle</b><br>
        We've adjusted the boxes so that when 2 boxes are on screen, next stop and the metrics box are now shown. Although the previous version (last stop + next stop + metrics as small text) did show more information, this will allow better readability of metrics!<br><br>
        <b>And other fun changes...</b><br>
        Any new release isn't without some other changes. Here's the fix list:
        <ul>
          <li>Fixing the FAQ page with various timings that were wrong</li>
          <li>Updating the appearance for the default zoom setting</li>
          <li>Warning mobile users that the smoothest smoothness settings will result in some zoom issues.</li>
          <li>Better spacing for elements in settings on very small devices</li>
          <li>Continuing to refine the horizontal shift system so it's even better!</li>
        </ul>
        We hope these improvements make the tracking experience even better. With that, this is the final release before the tracker launches on April 16, 2022 at 2:00 AM EDT. <br><br>
        We hope you're super excited to get tracking, we are too!

      </p>
      <p>
        Hello! Today we're proud to announce v5.6, the 2022 edition of track.easterbunny.cc.<br><br>
        This year focuses on some minor refinements to the tracking experience. So, while this release may not be as feature packed as in 2021, we hope you still enjoy the improvements we've got coming for you!<br><br>
        So, what's new in v5.6?<br><br>
        <b>Smoother tracker experience</b><br>
        We've done some work to make the tracking experience much more smooth in multiple ways. In short, the Easter Bunny icon on the map and metrics update at a faster rate this year, and you can configure this option!<br><br>
        By default, the marker now moves at 2 FPS and metrics update at 10 FPS - with additional options to make the tracker even smoother. On the smoothest option, metrics can update at 25 FPS, and the map can update at 20 FPS!<br><br>
        Plus, we've updated some code to use panning (rather than instantly setting the center).<br><br>
        <b>Arrival flags</b><br>
        A fun little addition, flags are now present on the last stop and next stop boxes, showing the flag of the country that the stop is in. You can turn these off in settings if you'd rather not see them.<br><br>
        <b>Refined stop accuracy</b><br>
        This year, we've once again refined our stop accuracy. You'll see improvements in the first hour or two of tracking, plus improving accuracy in some areas that didn't previously have stops.<br><br>
        We've also done some work to more accurately reflect what the Easter Bunny is doing during pre-tracking with improved communications from Easter Island.<br><br>
        <b>Prominent donation button on the tracker</b><br>
        Track.easterbunny.cc is designed to be ad-free, and this year we'll be keeping it this way. However, with tracker costs expected to run high again, there's a donation button in the tracker.<br><br>
        Donations are being accepted with Ko-fi at the moment (via PayPal). We're working to get Stripe working so you can simply enter a credit card number and the donation is done in Ko-fi!<br><br>
        Donations are also accepted in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. If you have another coin you want to donate, shoot us a DM on Twitter!<br><br>
        <b>Switching to gender neutral pronouns for the Easter Bunny</b><br>
        Throughout the tracker, you'll notice the Easter Bunny is referred to using gender neutral pronouns. Nobody quite knows the gender of the Easter Bunny, so that's now being reflected in the tracker.<br><br>
        <b>Other fixes and updates</b><br>
        With any release, we make lots of smaller updates to keep the tracker in tip-top shape. Here are those minor fixes:
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Explorer 11 support is dropped (Google Maps dropped support a while ago)</li>
          <li>Improved map styles - Light Mode Street now uses Google Maps' new colors, Dark Mode Street has seen minor improvements</li>
          <li>Yearly database updates so that extended stop information reflects the latest in population updates, etc.</li>
          <li>Added internal analytic insights so it's easier for us to see what's happening with the tracker (via the Geo API)</li>
          <li>Twitter updates on our main page are now every 30 minutes rather than 15 minutes</li>
          <li>UI updates to the settings panel, allowing you to easily get to the settings most frequently changed.</li>
        </ul>
        We hope you enjoy v5.6 and these new changes. Final preparation tracking gets underway April 16, 2022 at 2 AM EDT, with the Easter Bunny lifting off 3 hours later at 5 AM EDT.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hello! It's been a while since we last talked to you - 11 months precisely. We've got some updates for you on TEBCC v6 (well, the lack thereof), what's coming for 2022, and the future of track.easterbunny.cc.<br><br>
        <b>Where's v6?</b><br>
        track.easterbunny.cc v6 was planned to be a major overhaul of the tracker, allowing for better usability and maintainability over the long run of the tracker. However, refactoring an entire Easter Bunny Tracker while attempting to retain the same feature set and design is a very tricky task that ultimately requires a lot of time that I don't have.<br><br>
        I'm a solo developer who's also a college student, and so I couldn't make the time tradeoff to do this refactor, and to be honest, it got boring after a while! And while our current codebase definitely has its flaws, it's a very complete and stable tracker with a featureset that could easily last for another 2 years.<br><br>
        So, here's the deal. TEBCC v6 will be my excuse to completely rethink and redesign the tracker while also making the tracker modern for years to come. Framework, design language, it's all up in the air intentionally. I want v6 to be the best tracker that I can make. I expect v6 to come out in 2023 or 2024.<br><br>
        <b>Introducing track.easterbunny.cc v5.6</b><br>
        In lieu of v6 of TEBCC, I gladly introduce to you track.easterbunny.cc v5.6.0. This new version of track.easterbunny.cc will add some extra features to the tracker to further refine the experience, while still giving some stuff to look forward to this year. Changes are set to include:
        <ul>
          <li>Refined stop accuracy, especially in the opening hours of the tracker (5-8 AM)</li>
          <li>Prominent donation buttons on the website (more information about that soon)</li>
          <li>Optional display of flags in the last stop/next stop boxes</li>
          <li>Yearly updates to our database systems to keep the tracker running smooth.</li>
          <li>Switching to gender neutral pronouns for the Easter Bunny</li>
        </ul>
        In addition, you might see these features in TEBCC v5.7:
        <ul>
          <li>Smooth movement, which does exactly what it describes</li>
          <li>Baskets prepared metric during pre-tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Ads, donations, and keeping the tracker alive</b><br>
        Last year, I introduced a plan to keep the tracker going via ethical ads or other monetary platforms. Unfortunately, as a side effect of how I design things, it's incredibly hard to put any advertisements in the tracker without significantly disrupting the tracking experience. Once again, we will be going ad-free.<br><br>
        To combat rising costs, prominent donation buttons will be displayed on the tracker linking to various donation methods, and reasons to donate to the tracker. If you do enjoy the tracker, please consider donating a few bucks!<br><br>
        <b>The future of track.easterbunny.cc</b><br>
        2022 marks the fourth year of operations for track.easterbunny.cc, which is breaking records for the longest and most popular of my projects.<br><br>
        I hope that I can continue to run this Easter Bunny Tracker for years to come, as I do genuinely enjoy running it every year. It's definitely a lot of work to get it up and running, but it's worth it given how many people use and enjoy the tracker.<br><br>
        I hope in the next couple of years to get the tracker to the point where it's self-sustainable. I have no intentions of selling the tracker or transferring ownership of it any time soon. The tracker still has a long way to go - and we haven't even explored the possibilities of using the easterbunny.cc domain!<br><br>
        <b>Lastly, a thank you</b><br>
        Thank you so much for all the support of the Easter Bunny Tracker in the last three years - it's been amazing to see how many of you have enjoyed this tracker and the impact it's had! <br><br>
        Even with all the chaos of the world, I hope that on April 16, we can all take a moment to come together and enjoy the yearly tradition of tracking the Easter Bunny on its worldwide journey.

        track.orthodoxbunny.cc is our Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker! This is a side project we've been working on that mostly uses the same codebase as track.easterbunny.cc. We're experimenting in this area to see how much traction a secondary version of the Easter Bunny Tracker we run could potentially get. <br><br>
        tarck.orthodoxbunny.cc is also the testbed for new monetization methods to try and recoup some tracker costs. As such, you might see ads in the tracker, and links promoting our patreon and ko-fi. <br><br>
        The tracker will go live on May 1, 2021 at 2:00 AM EDT for pre-tracking. Tracking starts on May 1, 2021 at 5:00 AM EDT, and concludes on May 2, 2021 at 6:00 AM EDT. <br><br>
        This new tracker also has a twitter account (@trackorthobunny). We'll be tweeting out hourly updates on this twitter page, and there won't be a separate updates bot like for track.easterbunny.cc. <br><br>
        We hope you can come join this new tracker and give us some feedback!

        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('84'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-84" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-84</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Easter 2021. The year that we thought the tracker would grow a bit, but not by much. We thought COVID meant that our tracker grew so much last year - we couldn't possibly replicate 800% growth, let alone 200% growth again.
        <br><br>
        Cue tracking starting. We were not only floored, but speechless at the sheer amount of support we received from the very beginning. In just the first six hours of tracking, we crossed 10,000 hits. Last year, we crossed this milestone nearly 12 hours into tracking.
        <br><br>
        As the day went on, we were stunned at the growth - with estimates ranging around 300%-400%. By 6:30 PM EDT, the tracker reached the same amount of hits as it did last year. We were speechless - because we knew the peak of the traffic was yet to come.
        <br><br>
        Then, you all came out in droves. You pushed the tracker to nearly 200 hits a minute by 9 PM EDT, and held it there for about an hour and a half. All your support meant that by the end of tracking, we had a hit count with 6 digits.
        <br><br>
        <h5>102,203.</h5>
        <br>
        102,203 hits from 1 AM EDT 4/3 to 6 AM EDT 4/4, calculated using requests to the Geo API, called every time the tracker is loaded.
        <br><br>
        We had expected 50,000 hits at the most. 80,000 hits - a dream. 100,000 hits? That wasn't even on our radar.
        <br><br>
        While other trackers tried (and failed) to catch up to us with the bar from Version 4, we did it once again. We raised the bar for Easter Bunny Tracking with v5, providing another world-class tracking experience for the third year running.
        <br><br>
        As the Easter Bunny traversed the Earth, stopping at nearly 860 locations, we were there right alongside the Easter Bunny, tracking his every move for 28 hours.
        <br><br>
        We can't express enough gratitude for how thankful we are to be receiving 100,000+ hits in our third year of operation. It's hard to believe that just 2 years ago, our tracker had 4,000 hits, and was a barebones proof-of-concept to show that it was possible to make a tracker experience like NORAD & Google had. Fast forward to today - we've grown <b>26,500%</b> since 2019.
        <br><br>
        Let that sink in - every 65 minutes (on average), we got the same amount of traffic that we got in 28 hours in 2019.
        <br><br>
        During the course of tracking, we received approximately 47,000 unique visitors according to Cloudflare - and approximately 1.1 million requests for site assets. In total, about 19.21 GB of data was transferred during tracking. Given we served about ~1.2 MB of site assets on load (and that your browser caches the tracker for 8 hours), these are some pretty incredible statistics.
        <br><br>
        Using some estimation techniques, we estimated that around 150-200 visitors were with us from the transition from the countdown to pre-tracking. Last year's estimate was slightly too high, but it's an increase nonetheless.
        <br><br>
        track.easterbunny.cc was visited from approximately 100 countries around the world, but the top 5 this year are the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland in order.
        <br><br>
        Australian traffic peaked at about 7:00 AM EDT, UK traffic at 3:15 PM EDT, Ireland traffic at 4:00 PM EDT, Canada traffic at 8:30 PM EDT, and US traffic at 10 PM EDT. We also saw a massive surge of traffic from 6 PM to 10 PM, when the request rate increased by about 6x, something we've never seen before.
        <br><br>
        Cloudflare was once again crucial to ensure the tracker's stability and scalability. At peak, Cloudflare was serving ~99.1% of requests, meaning just 0.9% of requests hit our servers.
        <br><br>
        As other trackers completely banned streaming on YouTube by others, we shined yet again on YouTube. At peak, we estimate about ~550 people were watching us on YouTube, with a total of ~40,000-50,000 playbacks. Although these numbers are lower (given our competitors were directly streaming on YouTube with promotions everywhere), these are still amazing numbers. Combined with our website & streaming, our total view count was about 150,000.
        <br><br>
        With this being said, we've got some changes heading into 2022 with Version 6. After three incredible years, we're going to have to begin generating income from track.easterbunny.cc, and rebuild the tracker so we can continue to support our operations for future years. The massive increase in hits meant our map bill sits at a pretty $600 - and this is only expected to rise in future years.
        <br><br>
        First - we're going to do a complete refactor of the tracker, making it more maintainable and modern. During the refactor, we'll also add some new features, further enhancing your tracking experience. These features are being determined at the moment, we'll have some more information out soon.
        <br><br>
        Second - we're going to explore ways so that we can earn some money from the tracker. The goal is to cover just costs incurred by the map. This will include advertisements on the site, along with Patreon and Kofi one-time donations. We continue to respect your privacy, and are currently searching for ad networks that focus on serving ads ethically. We'll also make sure that ads do not disrupt the tracking experience.
        <br><br>
        We plan on using Track Orthodox Bunny, our sister site debuting in May 2021, to test these changes. We'll have more information about Track Orthodox Bunny soon, but consider joining us and giving your feedback.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for all your support this year. We're honored that so many people trusted us this year to track the Easter Bunny, and we can't wait for more to track with us next year.
        <br><br>
        As the Easter Bunny now rests from his long journey after delivering 5.815 billion baskets, eating 41.48 million carrots, and travelling 288,093 miles (that's the distance from the Earth to the Moon and then some!), we're ready for our rest as well. The tracker will stay online until April 10, 2021 at 12:00 AM EDT, before resetting to the countdown for 2022. Take some time to explore the map and see where the Easter Bunny visited - there's over 800 locations to explore!
        <br><br>
        We're so excited to see what's in store in 2022, and we can't wait. See you then!
        <br><br>
        Happy Easter to you and your family,<br>

      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc has been upgraded to v5.5.0. Although there's not a huge amount of user-facing changes with this release, we are making big strides on our back-end to ensure a better, more consistent tracking experience. Here's the full changelog.

          <li>Drastically improved the consistency of the Wikipedia descriptions in stops.</li>
          <li>Updated our population database with the latest information from March 2021 (this is important, not only does it mean the population counter in stop data is the same as what you'll see on Wikipedia, the baskets delivered count is more accurate.)</li>
          <li>Updated timezone database to IATA version 2021a.</li>
          <li>Minor updates to the FAQ page.</li>
          <li>Removed bulky modals for local storage unavailable & Geo API unavailable.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where visiting the FAQ/News/etc pages before visiting the tracker would load in the wrong set of default settings.</li>
          <li>Fixed styling bugs with some selection buttons having inconsistent line height.</li>

      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc has been upgraded to Version 5.4.1. This version fixes an issue with improper line heights in the settings window on the countdown page. We didn't see this issue in testing, so we only became aware of this bug when v5.4.0 was launched. <br><br>

      <p class="lead">Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 5!</p>
      <p>Posted: January 30, 2021 <br>
        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('72'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-72" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-72</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 5! Over the summer and winter, we've been refining and upgrading the tracking experience you know and love from 2020.
        <br><br>
        Last year was a big year for us - we established ourselves as a proper tracker, learned a lot from 2019, made some mistakes, and forgot some stuff. Think of Version 5 as the “this is what Version 4 would be if we weren't limited by time” release.
        <br><br>
        While other trackers are releasing books (books = improved tracking experience = profit??), we're continuing to focus on what we do best - improving our world-class tracking experience to the next level with. Here's what's new.
        <br><br>
        <b>Additional Metrics!</b><br>
        You asked for it. We provided. You can see five (5!!) metrics on the Easter Bunny. Baskets delivered, carrots eaten, speed (which is actually accurate unlike other trackers!), distance traveled, and distance from you. 
        <br><br>
        You can switch using a button on the right side of the metrics box, or in settings. You won't be able to see all the metrics are once though, as doing so would reduce tracker readability. We did think about having this option, but as things stand, it'd have to be desktop only (where there's enough room), and would require a decent code rewrite. Definitely a consideration for v6 in 2022.
        <br><br>
        Regardless, it's awesome! Whether you're a fan of seeing how fast the Easter Bunny hops, wondering how far the Easter Bunny goes (hint - pretty far!), or want to see how many snacks the Easter Bunny has had, we've got you covered.
        <br><br>
        <b>Mobile Metrics!</b><br>
        You can see metrics on mobile devices! Customizable through settings, it'll live in the next stop box with 1 box visible, or the last stop box with 2 boxes visible. We hope this significantly improves your mobile tracking experience.
        <br><br>
        <b>Better tracker localization!</b><br>
        As we continue to grow, our tracker is being used in more and more places with different unit, time, and number formats. Now, all times and numbers are localized to your locale in the tracker. We also added support for unit systems (automatically set for your locale), so the unit-sensitive metrics & data in the tracker appear correctly. Of course, you can change this in settings. 
        <br><br>
        This also extends to time & number formats in the tracker, they'll now be synced with your locale.
        <br><br>
        <b>Better stop detection, again!</b><br>
        We've gone overboard and now have even better stop detection. With 200+ more stops being detected compared to last year, we've doubled (yes, DOUBLED!) our accuracy since 2019.
        <br><br>
        What does this mean for you? A more detailed view of the Easter Bunny's whereabouts, better arrival time estimates, and stops closer to your location.
        <br><br>
        We've also enhanced the accuracy of the baskets delivered counter. Sorry about what happened last year Hong Kong. The Easter Bunny does deliver more than 5,000 baskets to Hong Kong.
        <br><br>
        <b>More information about stops</b><br>
        Ready for all the information about stops? You can enable a setting to see the Easter Bunny's local arrival time in settings. We've cut down on the filler space in the stop information window, and we added navigation arrows in the top right on tablet/desktop to quickly flip through stop information. <br><br>
        We're also conducting a full review of all the data we use for stop information, so there will hopefully be less inaccuracies compared to last year.
        <br><br>
        <b>Better settings organization</b><br>
        With so many settings to customize (there's 64,800 unique ways track.easterbunny.cc can be customized this year!), we've made major improvements to the settings window. 4 sections are used like last year, but we added icons next to each section so it's easier to know what section you're looking at.
        <br><br>
        We also cut down on a lot of text in the settings window so things are easier to read and less cluttered.
        <br><br>
        <b>Configurable default zoom level</b><br>
        Don't like the default zoom level of the tracker when it loads? You can change that now. Zoom level 4 fans rejoice! There's an indicator in settings to let you know what map zoom level is active during tracking, so if you're liking it a lot, you can easily change it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Fixing gray lines on the map (Chrome only)</b><br>
        You know those annoying gray lines you see on the map in Chrome? There's a setting to help reduce the visibility of those (at the cost of slightly distorted map labels). Definitely enable it if this was bothering you last year!
        <br><br>
        <b>Improved Easter Bunny estimated arrival time</b><br>
        We changed the .5 hours to the ½ symbol. The hour before arrival, the arrival time text goes to 1 hour, then 45 minutes, then 30 minutes, then indicates the Easter Bunny has arrived in your area (just in case your GeoIP location isn't exactly correct). And with better stop detection mentioned earlier, we'll have more accurate arrival times this year!
        <br><br>
        <b>Improving Twitter updates</b><br>
        We did a much better job in 2020 at our social media presence than 2019. With more features, we're doing a little changing on the social media side.
        <br><br>
        In short, we'll offer more consistent updates on bunny_tracking (there were gaps last year), and include the distance traveled metric on bunny_updates.
        <br><br>
        <b>The windows (modals) aren't centered anymore</b><br>
        200% easier to navigate the settings window. That's all.
        <br><br>
        <b>Making the optimized live stream settings MUCH better</b>
        We listened to your feedback. We watched your streams on YouTube in 2020. The optimized live stream settings is a combination of the features that your audiences like the most, mixed with settings that continue to preserve your privacy. Hybrid map, dark mode, with baskets delivered as the metric.
        <br><br>
        <b>Goodbye URL arguments</b><br>
        It's been removed in Version 5 to reduce bloat. Having them won't do any harm to the tracker, but it'll do nothing.
        <br><br>
        And lots of other features, including:
        <ul>
          <li>The settings window will yell at you if we can't get your IP location (and provide info on how to fix it)</li>
          <li>The settings window has integrated information on settings not persisting (rather than redirecting to another page)</li>
          <li>Fixed an annoying bug on iOS where going from portrait -> landscape -> portrait would result in a gap at the bottom of the tracker</li>
          <li>Cut down on text in many pages across the tracker, including this changelog post</li>
          <li>Page titles have been reordered</li>
          <li>Fixed many bugs!</li>
          <li>(Coming in v5.5) - Upgrading the browser detection system</li>
          <li>(Coming in v5.5) - Reorganizing the news page with separate pages per season</li>
          <li>(Coming in v5.5) - Patreon benefits to support track.easterbunny.cc, maybe. Still figuring out the logistics on that one.</li>
        </ul>
        With this, track.easterbunny.cc Version 5(.4.0) is official! We hope you enjoy all the new upgrades and changes made. In the coming weeks, we'll be releasing track.easterbunny.cc Version 5.5.0 with additional features and fixes to add the extra layer of polish to the tracker. <br><br>
        Tracking begins on Saturday, April 3, 2021 at 2 AM EST with no changes to the way tracking is run. That means 25 hours of tracking, with 3 hours of final preparation tracking (total of 28 hours). <br><br>
        Thanks for all the support! Enjoy v5!

      <p>Posted: July 1, 2020 <br>
        <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('69'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-69" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-69</a></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the first development update for track.easterbunny.cc Version 5! Even though the Easter Bunny lifts off in about 275 days, we're working super hard on building all the new features coming in Version 5. Here's how everything is going!
        <br><br>
        <b>Additional metrics</b> - The additional metrics feature is 98% done, aside from minor icon tweaking. You'll be able to select from Baskets Delivered, Carrots Eaten, Speed, and Distance Traveled as the four metrics.
        <br><br>
        There's a new menu in settings called Metric Settings, which will house the settings that go along with this fancy new feature. This is 100% done as of right now.
        <br><br>
        We've also built in automatic unit switching for speed & distance traveled. If your device's language is set to US English or British English, we'll show speed & distance traveled in mph/miles respectively. Otherwise, speed & distance will be shown in kph/kilometers respectively. Similar to the tracker appearance setting, you can manually set which unit to use.
        <br><br>
        We're currently working on porting over settings to the countdown page for additional metrics, which will be done soon.
        <br><br>  
        <b>Mobile metrics</b> - The mobile metrics feature is 95% done. It is currently working on phones, with the ability to switch the metric shown in metric settings. On phones that have tall aspect ratios (thus showing 3 boxes in landscape), we've made it so that the changes you make to the metric box in landscape sync to the metric shown in the next stop box. 
        <br><br>
        Currently we have a feature working to turn off the mobile metrics, but this is undergoing testing and the settings code hasn't been migrated to the countdown page.
        <br><br>
        <b>Major stop detection improvements</b> - This is about 90% done. We've done huge upgrades on our systems, and we're now able to detect over 800 stops during tracking. During tracking, you'll now see more 60-second updates in highly populated areas, as we find it adds some excitement to tracking.
        <br><br>
        We're still refining our systems on detecting a few more stops, but for the most part, we've managed to increase stop detection accuracy by another ~40%. This makes us by far the most accurate Easter Bunny Tracker (for some comparison, the next most accurate Easter Bunny Tracker had about 4.5x less stops last year compared to the number of expected stops this year).
        <br><br>
        <b>Navigation arrows in stop data</b> - This feature is 100% complete. In the stop information window, you'll now see two arrows to the left of where the X button lived last year. Clicking on these arrows will step you back (and forward) one stop in the stop information window, without having to click out of it, then find the previous stop, and click that basket.
        <br><br>
        When your map is uncentered (or if tracking is complete), upon clicking either the back & forward button (and for every subsequent click after), the map will pan to the location you are looking at.
        <br><br>
        With this, we've had to change the way modals appear on our website. We use modals for the stop information window, settings window, etc. Instead of modals being centered like it was in Version 4, it now is aligned with the top center of your screen. This was important for the navigation stop arrows - if the modal was centered, the positions of the back/forward arrows would change quite frequently.
        <br><br>
        A side effect of this change is that on mobile phones (and desktops too), you'll encounter more text wrapping for the city name. We're working to see if we can increase the width of the modal window on larger devices. We're also looking into potential different UI styles to avoid so much text wrapping.
        <br><br>
        <b>Default zoom level feature</b> - This feature is 99% complete. In the Map settings portion of settings, you'll now find a new area for the default zoom level feature, which has a dropdown allowing you to select the default zoom level of the map. This setting is used to determine what zoom level the map should be during tracking on load, when the map is recentered on the Easter Bunny, and when the transition from pre-tracking to tracking occurs.
        <br><br>
        You can select a default zoom level from Zoom Level 0 to 14. 15 or higher results in a poor tracking experience, so we don't allow this.
        <br><br>
        We've also included a handy tool in the default zoom level setting to see your current zoom level. This is useful when you find just the right zoom level, and you want to know exactly what that zoom level is.
        <br><br>
        The zoom level picker also has defaults for Level 5 on mobile, and Level 6 on desktop. These are dynamic depending on your platform.
        <br><br>
        We've also ported over the default zoom level feature to the countdown page, but there is a bit of additional testing that needs to occur.
        <br><br>
        <b>Removing the URL arguments feature</b> - URL arguments has been removed from the tracker, but not the countdown yet, making this feature about 75% complete. We've updated the URL arguments documentation page to indicate that this feature will be removed in Version 5.
        <br><br>
        URL arguments will continue to work in the tracker, and affect current settings up until the first public release of Version 5 (scheduled for early 2021). After this date, the tracker will ignore URL arguments.
        <br><br>
        <b>(Chromium-based browsers only) Option to fix gray lines in the map</b> - This feature is 50% complete. Currently the feature is working and does remove the gray lines in the map, but we haven't migrated the settings over to countdown, and need to do some additional testing with resetting settings. We're also continuing to test the browser filters so that this option only appears on affected devices.
        <br><br>
        This feature should be done by Development Update 2.
        <br><br>
        <b>Improving Twitter updates</b> - This is about 60% done. The code is there for Twitter update improvements. We've stuck with everything from last year, but we added the distance travelled metric, and the timestamp is now shown in UTC.
        <br><br>
        There is still testing that needs to be done with the new Twitter bot, and we're working on getting this up and running as soon as possible.
        <br><br>
        <b>Other minor improvements</b> - While we've been working on Version 5, we've also made some minor changes to add the extra cherry on top to your tracking experience. Here's a list of all the minor changes so far.
        <br>
        * Using moment.js, we now localize the time format to your area. If you're in the US, for instance, the arrival time will look something like June 28, 2020 at 3:00 PM EDT. But, in the UK, the arrival time will look something like 28 June 2020, 15:00 BST.
        <br>
        * The UK now has region-specific flags for Wales, England, Scotland & Northern Ireland.
        <br>
        * Improvements have been made to localize number formatting for baskets delivered, distance traveled, and speed.
        <br>
        * In the US, you'll see Distance traveled, but everywhere else Distance travelled.
        <br>
        * We've integrated the Local Storage unavailable warning into the tracker, rather than linking to an external page. You'll also see instructions for how to turn on local storage depending on your browser.
        <br>
        * A new warning in Tracker Settings will appear if an arrival estimate for the Easter Bunny cannot be calculated. We also fixed a bug where the description for this feature wasn't set correctly if the tracker was loaded after the EB arrived in your area, and there's a new description for this feature when tracking is complete.
        <br>
        * We fixed (mostly) a known bug from Version 3 & Version 4 where Safari on iOS would leave a blank space at the bottom of the page after rotating from horizontal to vertical. We've implemented some code to trick Safari into showing the bottom bar again. This is working on iOS 13.5.1, and does not affect the tracker when using fullscreen mode.
        <br><br>
        In addition to the features mentioned above, there's still lots to work on! Here's how things are panning out in the short term.
        <br><br>
        <b>Orthodox Version of track.easterbunny.cc</b> - In the original post about Version 5, I mentioned that the Orthodox tracker will be hosted on orthodox.track.easterbunny.cc. I've now decided that the tracker will be hosted on track.orthodoxbunny.cc. TOBCC, as we're coining it, is currently being set up with Version 4.5.4 of TEBCC. The site will hopefully be up in 2-3 weeks, with some special FAQs & news articles relating to TOBCC.
        <br><br>
        TOBCC will start on Version 0.5.4, with the first version of TOBCC based on the first public v5 release of TEBCC. After TEBCC's run in April 2020, we'll transition over to working more on TOBCC.
        <br><br>
        <b>Preview site of track.easterbunny.cc for streamers</b> - This feature is coming to Version 5 of track.easterbunny.cc, but later in development. Since the preview site is basically the main tracker (minus tracker logic, etc), we're waiting for most of TEBCC v5 development to be complete before we start working on the preview website.
        <br><br>
        <b>Improving horizontal shift on tablets</b> - The code for this feature is in place in Version 5, and we're currently testing this feature.
        <br><br>
        <b>New FAQ/News page style</b> - As the number of FAQs & News articles gets longer and longer, in the coming weeks, we'll be switching the FAQ & News pages to accordion-based lists. This will mean easy browsing for the FAQ or News article you wish to read, at which point, you can click on that FAQ or News article to expand the full text.
        <br><br>
        <b>Games on the website? No</b> - We suggested in the announcement for TEBCC v5 that games might be coming to TEBCC in the future. I'd like to follow this up with the fact that this will likely not happen for a while.
        <br><br>
        We're committed to making the best tracker on the internet, and as such have had to sacrifice additional content on our website for this to happen. Beyond Version 5, we're looking into building good native apps on iOS/Android for TEBCC, and continuing to expand TOBCC, so at this point games aren't coming for a long, long while.
        <br><br>
        And that's Development Update 1! This will be the longest of the development updates, as we're currently working through the busy phase of adding features to the tracker. As we continue into July & August, the rate at which features are added will start to slow, and we'll focus more on testing the tracker, and expanding TOBCC.
        <br><br>
        Development Update 2 will be posted in about 2 weeks! See you then!

      <p class="lead">2021 preparations are beginning for track.easterbunny.cc Version 5!</p>
      <p>Posted: May 23, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('65'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-65" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-65</a></span></p>
      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc Version 5 is now beginning development, after two successful tracking runs. <br><br>
        Version 5 will make smaller, but noticeable improvements to Version 4 of track.easterbunny.cc. We're also excited to be expanding the tracker to allow for exciting innovations in the space of Easter Bunny Tracking. <br><br>
        Without further ado, here's what we have planned for Version 5 of track.easterbunny.cc! <br><br>
        <b>Customization of the baskets delivered box with more metrics</b> - A lot of you have been asking for additional metrics in track.easterbunny.cc, such as carrots eaten, speed, and distance traveled. We're proud to say that we're going to implement this in Version 5, but in a unique way. <br><br>
        Rather than throwing all of these metrics, you'll have the ability to customize the baskets delivered box with a button in the top-right corner. This will allow you to switch between Baskets Delivered, Carrots Eaten, Speed, and Distance Traveled, and show one metric at a time. This will allow you to focus on a certain metric, or switch quickly to another metric at any time. We're also looking into possibly cycling the metrics automatically at a set interval, but this is not confirmed. <br><br>
        <b>Major stop detection improvements</b> - This year, we begun improving the stop detection in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, and many of you enjoyed these improvements. The US was finally not a snoozefest! We also got lots of feedback that many places around the world were lacking in the amount of stops shown on the tracker, and we've also learned a thing or two about presenting more stops in the tracker. <br><br>
        This year, we plan to improve stop detection by about 40-45%, while also bringing 60-second updates to densely populated areas. We're looking to improve stop detection in Canada, Russia, China, SE Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and South America.
        <br><br>
        Under the same category, we're also planning to improve the accuracy of the baskets delivered count, as many of you notably pointed out that the baskets delivered count wasn't super accurate once the Easter Bunny arrived in the Americas. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Orthodox Version of track.easterbunny.cc</b> - track.easterbunny.cc focuses on Western Easter, but some of our users in 2020 wanted us to restart the tracker to align with Orthodox Easter, which is celebrated on a different date. Beginning in 2021, track.easterbunny.cc will track the Easter Bunny on both the Western and Eastern dates of Easter. The Western tracker will remain on track.easterbunny.cc, but we'll also be launching a specific orthodox.track.easterbunny.cc tracker as well, sometime in late 2020. <br><br>
        The Orthodox tracker will run in the same manner as our main tracker. We're still looking into the exact specifics of running two tracker instances at once, and we hope to provide more information in a few months once everything is sorted out.
        <br><br>
        <b>Preview site of track.easterbunny.cc for live streaming</b> - As we continue to be the most popular tracker on YouTube, we want to continue to help people who are live streaming the tracker get the most out of our tracker. <br><br>
        We're hoping to work on a preview site of track.easterbunny.cc, where you can preview how the tracker will look on Easter before the big event. This means you can position overlays, text, and make sure that your stream is setup properly to capture the entire tracker. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Bringing baskets delivered metrics on mobile</b> - As phones keep getting bigger and the average screen size gets larger and larger, we're left with phones having 18:9 or 21:9 aspect ratios, giving us more vertical space to show tracker information on mobile. <br><br>
        This year, we'll be putting the baskets delivered count in the next stop box on mobile phones. The implementation for this feature will depend on how tall your phone is - if there's enough screen space available, the text will be added. If there isn't enough space, the text won't be added. <br><br>
        Specifics on this issue will be worked out as we develop Version 5, such as if the next stop text is hidden, will the baskets delivered text appear instead, and how disabling this text in settings will work. <br><br>
        We don't intend on allowing metric switching on mobile at this time, but we will provide finalized information when Version 5 releases.
        <br><br>
        <b>Improving horizontal shift feature on tablets</b> - This year, the horizontal shift feature worked great on mobile phones, allowing you to properly use the tracker in horizontal mode. However, tablets did have some known issues where a horizontal shift should occur, but it didn't. We'll be working to get this issue fixed.
        <br><br>
        <b>TEBCC API</b> - This year, we will be experimenting with launching a track.easterbunny.cc API (application programming interface), which will allow applications to pragmatically call our servers to get information on the Easter Bunny's whereabouts. Applications will then be able to use that information to power a wide variety of experiences, such as asking voice assistants where the Easter Bunny is, or 3rd-party applications for tracking the Easter Bunny.
        <br><br>
        <b>Navigation arrows in stop data</b> - If you wanted to explore all the places where the Easter Bunny went in 2020, it was a bit tough. This year, we'll be adding navigation arrows to the bottom (or top - this is TBD!) of the stop data window, so that you can more easily explore where the Easter Bunny has gone.
        <br><br>
        <b>Default zoom level</b> - If you're not a fan of our default zoom level settings, we'll be adding the option to change the default zoom level the tracker runs at when it loads, and when you recenter the Easter Bunny.
        <br><br>
        <b>(Chrome only) Adding an option to fix gray lines in the map</b> - Chrome is chrome, and sadly Chrome has an issue where when the page is zoomed in, gray lines are visible in the map. We'll be adding a native setting in the tracker to apply a fix (at the expense of slightly distorted map labels).
        <br><br>
        <b>Removing the URL arguments feature</b> - The URL arguments feature is something we're considering feature bloat, and we don't believe that the feature adds enough to the tracker to keep it around and maintained with all the new features coming onboard this year.
        <br><br>
        <b>Improving Twitter updates</b> - We will continue to separate tweets on @bunny_updates and @bunny_tracking, but we will make some improvements. On @bunny_tracking, we will try to have more consistent 15 minute update intervals, which will increase in densely populated areas. On @bunny_updates, we will be updating the bot to show the last stop, current stop, and next stop to avoid potential confusion. We will also be switching the timestamp to UTC from EDT.
        <br><br>
        <b>Games on the website? Not yet.</b> - But, we are looking into it. Version 5 should be the last version with major updates to the tracker (Version 6 will of course feature improvements, just to a lesser extent). As such, we will start looking into expanding the tracker in terms of the social media footprint, and in terms of extra content on the site in 2022.
        <br><br>
        Due to the situation with Covid-19, it has changed how Version 5 will be developed. We'll be doing the bulk of development in summer 2020, with QA performed over Fall/Winter 2020. Version 5 will be released sometime in January/February 2021.
        <br><br>
        Version 5 is a collection of useful features & fixes that we weren't able to implement in Version 4 due to time limitations. We hope that these features will once again improve your tracking experience, and further expand Easter Bunny Tracking to a wider audience.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for all of your support!

      <p class="lead">track.easterbunny.cc is going open source, and has been upgraded to v4.5.4!</p>
      <p>Posted: May 10, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('62'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-62" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-62</a></span></p>
      <p>
       track.easterbunny.cc is going open source! With that, we also upgraded the tracker to Version 4.5.4. <br><br>
       Going open source means that anyone can see the code that powers the Easter Bunny tracker. We're also releasing the source code for the Geo API, Twitter Bot, and various tools to make the tracker run. <br><br>
       We decided to release our source code for a few reasons. <br><br>
       1 - We've seen that many people have been inspired by track.easterbunny.cc to make their own Easter Bunny and Santa Tracker, and learn how to code. We're honored to have been the driving force for people to build new things, and we want to help in as many ways as possible. By open sourcing our tracker, anyone will be able to look at our source code for some inspiration in another project, or even modify our base source code to make unique versions of the tracker never seen before. We can't wait to see what you make!
       <br><br>
       2 - After two incredibly successful runs with tons of support coming from the Easter Bunny tracking community (including you!), we wanted to pay it back to the community by making the tracker available to everyone who enjoys it and supports it.
       <br><br>
       3 - Open source community! By having our tracker available for anyone to inspect and improve upon, we're opening the floodgates to community-driven contributions. Anyone will be able to fork the tracker repository, make changes that they want to see to the tracker, and then request for those changes to be merged. Best of all - we're planning to develop track.easterbunny.cc Version 5 in the open-source repository in real-time! 
      <br><br>
       You can find the repository for track.easterbunny.cc at <a href="https://gitlab.com/track-easterbunny-cc/tebcc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gitlab.com/track-easterbunny-cc/tebcc</a>. We also have many other repositories available, and our organizational page is located at <a href="https://gitlab.com/track-easterbunny-cc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/track-easterbunny-cc</a>.
       <br><br>
       It's important to note that we licensed the tracker under the GNU AGPL license. In short: the GNU AGPL is a strong copyleft license, following a pay it forward mantra. If you download our source code, modify it with your own changes, then distribute that modified code through a website, app, etc, you'll be required to distribute your source code under GNU AGPL as well. The same applies if you're incorporating the tracker into a larger website, system, app, etc. You have to release the source code of the entire system under GNU AGPL v3.
       <br><br>
       We understand that this is a tedious - even a bit excessive. However, we want the tracker to stay open source forever, and the GNU AGPL helps us achieve that goal. It'll also mean that other people will be able to build on and improve the changes that others made to the tracker.
       <br><br>
       With the open-sourcing of the tracker, Version 4.5.4 of track.easterbunny.cc has been released with a few minor changes.
       <ul>
        <li>The Terms of Service is no longer in effect, and has been superseded by the GNU AGPL v3.0 license. Although you do not need to accept the full GNU AGPL license to use the tracker, we require you to accept that the tracker is provided as-is, has no warranty to the greatest legal extent possible, and that we cannot be held liable for damages that result from using the tracker.</li>
        <li>The about windows have been updated to have links to the licenses & source code repositories.</li>
        <li>The FAQ page has been updated with some FAQs about the tracker going open source.</li>
        <li>All the page titles have been updated to Easter Bunny Tracker 2023.</ul>
       </ul>
      Version 5 development is going to be kicked off shortly - and we'll have a full changelist available in about 2-3 weeks with what we plan to add & change in Version 5. <br><br>
      We're incredibly thrilled to be the first open-source Easter Bunny Tracker on the planet, and we hope you are too!
      </p>

      <h3>2020 - Version 4</h3>
      <hr class="styledhr" id="pid-59">
      <p class="lead">Thank you for an amazing Easter 2020!</p>
      <p>Posted: April 12, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('59'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-59" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-59</a></span></p>
      <p>
        Easter 2020 will always be remembered as the time where track.easterbunny.cc grew by 850% - because this is what exactly happened.
        <br><br>
        We set out earlier this year to build upon and refine the innovative and ground-breaking tracking experience that you loved last year. To say the least, our efforts paid off. We showed again what real Easter Bunny tracking looks like, even as other websites did their best to try and match our tracker.
        <br><br>
        During the course of tracking, we were floored by the amount of support the tracker received in its second run. We expected, at most, about 150-200% growth compared to last year. We were not expecting 850% growth, but it showed just how scalable our tracker is, in that it could handle 8x the traffic that we were expecting.
        <br><br>
        We don't use Google Analytics on our website, because we value your privacy. However, using some stats from the Geo API, and from how many times our website queried the Google Maps API, we can approximate that we received about 35,000 hits during the course of tracking.
        <br><br>
        The numbers from tracking on Cloudflare's side are even more impressive. We received about 14,000 unique visitors and about 300,000 total requests for site assets.
        <br><br>
        During the course of tracking, our website served 3.9 GB of site assets. Given that we're still a pretty lightweight tracker, and that on page load Cloudflare serves about 650 KB of site assets, these are some incredible numbers. 
        <br><br>
        We also estimate that about 120-160 users joined us for the transition from countdown to pre-tracking. This is an increase from last year, where we estimated that about 30-40 users joined us for the transition from countdown to pre-tracking.
        <br><br>
        Cloudflare was, again, incredibly useful to ensure the scalability, availability, and reliability of the tracker. During the course of tracking, our tracker had a ~98% cache hit rate, meaning only 2% of requests made it to our origin server.
        <br><br>
        Track.easterbunny.cc also performed exceptionally well on YouTube streams, as it did last year. While other trackers shunted the tracking community, prohibiting the streaming of their tracker online, we openly encouraged people to share and stream our tracker, and even provided some helpful tips on Twitter for streamers. At peak, track.easterbunny.cc was being watched by approximately 700-800 people on YouTube concurrently. From the data that we can gather, track.easterbunny.cc was also viewed approximately 57,000 times on YouTube (playbacks). To everyone who streamed track.easterbunny.cc - we can't thank you enough for helping to spread the Easter cheer in a time where we need it the most.
        <br><br>
        The track.easterbunny.cc Twitter bot also ran exceptionally well, and had no issues throughout the course of tracking to post tweets. Additionally, we will continue to separate out the bunny's updates, as we believe it gives people more choice in controlling how many tweets they see about the Easter Bunny on Easter. We plan to add a few more scheduled tweets for the bunny_tracking account, as they were a bit sparse at times.
        <br><br>
        Even with all the improvements, the tracking community had lots of feedback to give about the tracker, and where we could make improvements for 2021.
        <br><br>
        The biggest request for 2021 is the addition of extra metrics - like carrots eaten, speed, and eggs delivered. We're already brainstorming how to add in these extra metrics into the tracker. We also got a lot of feedback about the improved stop detection - while the difference was highly visible in the US/UK, there are many countries and areas that need better stop detection. We will be working next year to improve the coverage in those areas, similar to what we did this year.
        <br><br>
        We also got requests, as we do every year, to add games and other activities to our website. Given that we're still only two years old, we're doing everything we can to focus on the core of the tracker, before building out the website to include games and other activities. However, we do hear you loud and clear, and it's something that we will add in future years.
        <br><br>
        We also noted some areas for improvement with the tracker. Some of these include integrating the countdown into the tracker for a full experience, adding PWA (progressive web app) functionality, improving mobile usability with what data is shown, along with some other minor improvements. 
        <br><br>
        Over the summer and winter, we'll be working on major upgrades to Version 5 using feedback that you provided, along with the areas we noted for improvement.

        Our site will remain online until May 1, 2020. We encourage you to explore the map, and see where the Easter Bunny has been. You can click on the baskets on the map to learn more about the cities where the Easter Bunny has stopped.
        <br><br>
        After tracking the Easter Bunny's preparations & movements for 28 hours, and after successfully delivering 4.400 billion baskets, it's time we say goodbye for 2020. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for a second year of tracking that we will never forget. 
        <br><br>
        Thank you all for an incredible year, and we cannot wait for 2021!
        <br><br>
        Happy Easter to you and your family, <br>

      <p class="lead">Tips to get the most out of your tracking experience - 2020 Edition</p>
      <p>Posted: April 8, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('56'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-56" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-56</a></span></p>
      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc is the world's most simple, yet advanced Easter Bunny tracker. Our tracker is simple to use and understand, and we have a wide variety of features and systems so that you can customize your tracking experience if you so desire.
        <br><br>
        We have 20 tips for you on how to get the most out of your tracking experience, similar to what we did last year. Without further ado, here are the tips for this year!
        <br><br>
        <h5>1 - No refreshing is required!</h5>
        No refreshing is required. Of course it isn't! You don't need to have auto-refreshing plugins to use our site.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>2 - This year, we have only one redirect from countdown to pre-tracking</h5>
        Last year, our tracker had two redirects, one from countdown to pre-tracking, and pre-tracking to tracking. This year, we only have one redirect from countdown to pre-tracking.
        <br><br>
        During the 2 AM redirect, please be patient as the tracker loads in, as we asked you last year. We don't expect any issues and for everyone to have the tracker loaded within 30 seconds. If the tracker doesn't load within 30 seconds, refresh the page.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>3 - Change settings before tracking starts so the tracker is configured</h5>
        You can change tracker settings before tracking starts. Settings will carry over from the countdown page to the tracker. We recommend for the best experience that you pre-configure the tracker so you don't have to mess with it once tracking begins.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>4 - Settings are saved automatically every time they're changed</h5>
        As you change settings, you'll see a message pop up saying "Settings have been saved". As you go along changing settings, they will change the tracker in real time. You'll also be able to see some changes, like the appearance and map mode change in the background as you are changing them.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>5 - Want to change the default zoom level? Use URL arguments</h5>
        We default the tracker zoom level to 5 on mobile devices and 6 on desktop devices. If you're not okay with this, you can use the URL arguments feature to set the default zoom level when the tracker loads, and when the map is recentered. This is known as a full zoom override.
        <br><br>
        If you want your default zoom level to be 8, for instance, you can request the tracker by using this URL: <code>https://track.easterbunny.cc/?zl=8</code>
        <br><br>
        If you only want to change the zoom on load, and not change the zoom level for when the map is recentered, you can instead use a partial zoom override by appending <code>!</code> to the end of the zoom level: <code>https://track.easterbunny.cc/?zl=8!</code>
        <br><br>
        You can use the URL arguments feature to change many other aspects of the tracker. Check out the docs here: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/urlarguments">https://track.easterbunny.cc/urlarguments</a>
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>6 - Looking for the track.easterbunny.cc Version 3 experience? The tracker is configurable to the v3 experience!</h5>
        We planned to implement a reset button for the classic default settings that the tracker ran with in 2019, but didn't have enough time.
        <br><br>
        For the 2019 look, set the appearance to dark, map mode to hybrid, and make sure the bunny bouncing effect is also off. For the true 2019 look, you can also turn off the estimated arrival time (but it's a cool feature so we recommend you leave it on)
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>7 - You'll want to turn off the Easter Bunny arrival time estimate if you're streaming, or if you have a smaller device</h5>
        We allow you to turn off the Easter Bunny arrival time estimate (which is new this year) in settings. This is good if you don't want to reveal your location when streaming the tracker.
        <br><br>
        This also causes issues on smaller phones (usually on 5 inch and under phones) where the text will hide the Easter Bunny icon. If you don't want this, then we recommend turning off the feature on smaller phones.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>8 - Using a VPN will cause inaccurate arrival time estimates.</h5>
        We use an IP-based system to determine your approximate location. If you have a VPN on, we'll estimate the location at the VPN server, rather than your location.
        <br><br>
        To get around this, turn off your VPN before the tracker transitions from countdown to pre-tracking/tracking, then turn it back on. If at any time you need to refresh the tracker, follow the similar procedure - turn off your VPN, load the site, then turn it back on.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>9 - If you're travelling (which you shouldn't be), refresh your page every so often so that the arrival time can update</h5>
        When the tracker loads, we calculate your arrival time once for the remainder of your session on the website. If you are travelling (which you shouldn't be given the current situation with COVID-19), refresh the tracker every hour or two so that the arrival time is more accurate.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>10 - Settings are applicable to one browser on one device. If you're using multiple devices for tracking, set the settings on each device to the same!</h5>
        We do not have, and don't expect to implement any sort of cloud saving for your settings. Right now, all settings are stored on your device, and are specific for one browser on your device.
        <br><br>
        If you use multiple browsers, say Chrome and Firefox, your settings will not sync between the two. Chrome will have its own settings, and so will Firefox.
        <br><br>
        The same goes if you're using the tracker on multiple devices. Settings will not sync as we do not have any cloud saving functionality. To keep things consistent, you'll probably want to set the same settings for all of your devices.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>11 - The Easter Bunny bouncing effect will use more battery, turn this off if you're trying to save battery!</h5>
        The Easter Bunny bouncing effect doubles the CPU usage of the tracker (from about 6% to 12% on desktops in testing). This also happens on mobile devices, and will mean less battery life on mobile devices.
        <br><br>
        If you're using the tracker and need to conserve battery life, make sure this option is off.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>12 - Need to zoom in on the tracker page? Use Street mode with Light mode forced on</h5>
        As was the case last year, you'll still see gray horizontal lines on the map when the page is zoomed in, mostly due to issues with the Google Maps API that we use. This effect can be minimized when the tracker is in light mode with street mode enabled.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>13 - If you're recording a timelapse of the tracker, refresh the tracker every 6-8 hours</h5>
        We've noted an issue where the bunny will start to become more jittery after about 10 hours of continuous usage in timelapses. Refresh the tracker every 6-8 hours to get the best timelapse possible. The tracker loads in less than 5 seconds, so you should be able to sneak in a tracker load at the right time.
        <br><br>
        Of course, this is a known issue with the previous bunny icon. We don't know how it'll work out with the new higher resolution icon.
        <br><br>
        This doesn't affect the actual tracking experience, but rather, a small issue that is more apparent when the tracker is played back at very high speeds.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>14 - We'll be tweeting out updates on how the Easter Bunny is doing on two accounts, with two very different methodologies</h5>
        If you're up for some Easter Bunny tracking on Twitter, we've got you covered. We set up two different accounts this year because we have two very different ways we're running Twitter tracking this year.
        <br><br>
        On our @bunny_tracking twitter, we'll be tweeting every 15-30 minutes about general updates from the Easter Bunny. This will include where the Easter Bunny has been, and where we project the Easter Bunny to go in the next half hour to hour. We'll also tweet the baskets delivered count as well. This is good if you want to keep up with the Easter Bunny's progress without the nitty gritty details.
        <br><br>
        On our @bunny_updates twitter, we've set up a bot to tweet every stop the Easter Bunny makes, along with all the pre-tracking updates. During tracking, we'll tweet the last seen location (where the bunny just stopped at), the next stop, and baskets delivered. This account will tweet every 5 or so minutes, but the interval comes down to 1-2 minutes when in busy areas. This will spam your Twitter feed, so we HIGHLY recommend that if you follow this account, you set your Twitter feed to latest tweets first.
        <br><br>
        And now, a few notes from when we did QA on the tracker about certain features.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>15 - Automatic appearance synced with your system only works on modern devices, otherwise it defaults to light mode</h5>
        We've found that it works best on Windows 10 1903 or newer, macOS 10.14 or newer, iOS 13 or newer, and Android 10 and newer.
        <br><br>
        Samsung devices running Android 9 (One UI 1.0/1.5) have a dark mode implementation but it isn't system wide, so it won't actually get picked up by Chrome, Firefox, etc.
        <br><br>
        On all other devices that don't support automatic appearance, we will default to light mode.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>16 - Samsung Internet doesn't work with auto dark mode</h5>
        We've noted this in QA, and a warning will show up in settings. Samsung Internet doesn't report if the device is in dark mode or not, but instead tints and darkens the website. This doesn't look good, so make sure that you turn off your device's dark mode, then use the dark mode built into the tracker.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>17 - Dark mode not working on Firefox Desktop, even though your device is in dark mode? Change the Firefox theme</h5>
        Click on the hamburger menu in the top right, then find Customize. On the bottom, click on Themes, then click Default so that it syncs to your OS settings.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>18 - Have dark mode synced to the sunrise/sunset on your device? You'll need to lock and unlock your device for the appearance mode to switch if you leave the tracker on all the time</h5>
        After some further testing, we noted that on macOS 10.15 Catalina, iOS 13 and Android 10, auto dark mode will not come on unless you lock, then unlock your device after sunrise/sunset. This shouldn't be much of an issue if you use the tracker, lock your device for some time, then come back when the sun has set or risen. The tracker will be in the right appearance mode.
        <br><br>
        If you leave the tracker on all the time, then you will need to lock and unlock your device for dark mode to come into effect.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>19 - Need help? We'll be on Twitter and email during tracking with under 15 minute response times.</h5>
        Starting on 4/10 at 12 AM EDT and until 4/12 at 8 AM EDT, we'll be monitoring the @bunny_tracking & @bunny_updates Twitter pages along with our support email (support {at} easterbunny {dot} cc) with under 15 minute response times.
        <br><br>
        If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or want to chat, we'll be here!
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>20 - Have fun and share the love of tracking!</h5>
        We're still in our second year of operation, and we'd love it if you could share our tracker so that more people can enjoy the best Easter Bunny tracking experience around.
        <br><br>
        Even though we're in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and our hearts go out to everyone who is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that our Easter Bunny tracker can put a smile on your face, or bring some joy into your life in an otherwise unusual and stressful time for us all.
        <br><br><br>
        We hope these tips can help you get the most out of your tracking experience. If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us on Twitter, or via email.

      <p>Posted: April 7, 2020 <br>
        Updated: April 8, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('53'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-53" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-53</a></span></p>
      <p>
        Usually after the final release before tracking, we work on a lot of improvements in the background to ensure the tracker is ready to go, and fix many little issues. Usually, these fixes aren't enough to justify a new release of the tracker. <br><br>
        However, we've been fixing so many issues that we decided to have a new, proper release. And with that, we're happy to announce track.easterbunny.cc Version 4.5.3! Version 4.5.3 should be the final version that we track with. See what's new below! 
        <ul>
          <li>Added hover over text to the icons in the bottom left icon stack</li>
          <li>Added known issue about the Easter Bunny icon sometimes distoring when zooming in and out of th tracker, and with the bunny icon jittering in timelapses after a long while.</li>
          <li>Added a base redirect page for the local storage page</li>
          <li>Added higher resolution icons to the tracker!!!!! It's a night and day difference with the new icon resolutions because they look so, so, so much better.</li>
          <li>Reordered the reset & advanced settings placement in the settings window. Reset settings has gone back home to the bottom of the stack, and advanced settings is now above reset settings.</li>
          <li>Fixed a major issue where after resetting the settings to default/stream optimized, the settings window would get glitched and the tracker would require a full refresh</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue where the argument syntax checking wouldn't show a warning icon for the zoom level argument when the value was not correct</li>
          <li>Fixed some very minor issues on the privacy policy page</li>
          <li>Fixed some issues with icons not properly rendering on some devices</li>
          <li>Fixed issues with the info icon and cog icon being ever so slightly out of alignment</li>
          <li>Fixed issues with the browser name or version showing up as undefined in the FAQs, incompatible browser, and local storage unavailable pages</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue where /urlarguments.html would take you to the FAQs page</li>
          <li>Updated our site slogan! You should now be seeing this in search engines.</li>
          <li>Updated the Geo API one final time as of April 7, 2020. If you wanted to opt your IP out of the database we use so that it wouldn't return a location, it is now too late, as the next update of the database will be released after tracking. Same applies in the opposite direction (opting in your IP after you opted out).</li>
          <li>Updated the privacy policy to reflect that opt outs are no longer available for the 2020 run of the tracker.</li>
          <li>Updated the known issues page to reflect recent OS releases (iOS 12.4.6) and to fix some grammar issues as well.</li>
        </ul>
        And that's Version 4.5.3, the release that should squash all the bugs in the tracker. We hope to post some tips to get the most out of your tracking experience tomorrow (April 8, 2020), similar to what we did last year. We're also super, super, super excited to get tracking in just a few days! <br><br>
        Update (April 8, 2020): We have just fixed a critical bug in the tracker due to the new higher resolution icons where clicking on the map in certain places nearby a basket icon would bring up the stop data window. This was caused by wrongly defining the anchor & origin of the higher resolution icons. 
      </p>

      <p class="lead">track.easterbunny.cc upgraded to v4.5.2</p>
      <p>Posted: April 4, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('50'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-50" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-50</a></span></p>
      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc Version 4.5.2 is here, bringing some critical bug fixes and otherwise minor improvements to the overall tracking experience. See what's new below!
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a major issue where the zoom level argument would not work with the tracker.</li>
          <li>Flipped around the settings and icon icons on the bottom left of the tracker. This means that the info icon is at the bottom of the stack. We made this change according to user feedback regarding the matter, and we personally think that it's easier to remember that you change settings using the top button in the stack, and get info at the bottom icon in the stack.</li>
          <li>Added partial and full overrides for the zoom level argument. A full override is how the zoom level argument currently is now - meaning the zoom level on load <b>AND</b> the zoom level used when rencetering the map is set to that in the URL arguments. A partial override, indicated by "!" after the zoom level (for instance, ?zl=8! for zoom level 8 partial override) will only change the on load zoom level.</li>
          <li>Improved documentation about the zoom level argument, including additions about the partial/full zoom level overrides, and what the different zoom levels mean.</li>
          <li>Changed the styling of the code element in dark mode for more readability and contrast. It's now a light blue color.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where the tracker would freeze if the tracker were to be requested in the final second of tracking (5:59:59.500 AM - 6:00:00.000 AM on 4/12/2020), as the map would not have finished loading. The code has been updated to recognize when the map is not available so it tries again 500ms later.</li>
        </ul>
        Version 4.5.2 will likely be the last version before we start tracking in just 7 days. We're still testing the tracker, but since v4.5.0, we've frozen significant portions of the codebase. <br><br>
        In the coming days, we'll be posting on how to get the most out of your tracking experience, similar to how we made a post last year. <br><br>
        One week from when this is posted, we'll be tracking the Easter Bunny! We're now starting to transition over towards final preparations and making sure everything is ready to go!
      </p>
      <hr class="styledhr" id="pid-46">
      <p class="lead">track.easterbunny.cc upgraded to v4.5.1</p>
      <p>Posted: April 1, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('46'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-46" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-46</a></span></p>
      <p>
        This is no April Fools, track.easterbunny.cc Version 4.5.1 is here! Version 4.5.1 brings improvements to the overall tracker experience in preparation before launch, and to clear things up with how you can use our tracker and your privacy when using the tracker. See what's new below!
        <ul>
          <li>We've added a proper terms of service to the website, describing what you can and can't do with our tracker (tl;dr: you can almost do whatever you want with our tracker so long as it isn't illegal). You can read the ToS at <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/terms">https://track.easterbunny.cc/terms</a>.</li>
          <li>We've updated the privacy policy to make it clear our stance on 3rd party data usage (tl;dr: we don't sell or share your data with 3rd parties and we never will), and about personally identifying information (tl;dr: we don't collect personally identifying information and have no plan to build anything that would).</li>
          <li>For anyone making thumbnails, or anyone that needs the site icon: We have a new icon assets page that allows you to download the site icon in a variety of sizes. You can visit it at <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/iconassets">https://track.easterbunny.cc/iconassets</a>.</li>
          <li>We're improving stop detection again - by about 3% (for a grand total of about 40% over last year!!). Users in Japan/South Korea, the United Kingdom/Ireland will now see more detailed stops in their respective areas. We've also made some general improvements to stop detection. (tl;dr: we're the most accurate tracker)</li>
          <li>The FAQ page has been updated to reflect new features and findings from v4.5.1.</li>
          <li>We've improved the error code pages with more links, and now with the version number of the tracker. We also added custom error code pages for HTTP 400, 401, and 503. You probably won't see error code 503 (service unavailable), because we plan to not crash.</li>
          <li>The Geo API database has been updated to the latest available from MaxMind (Remember! If you don't want your IP returning a location for the arrival time, please opt out of the database as described on the privacy page by April 6!)</li>
          <li>If you're curious and take a trip to the homepage of the Geo API, we've updated it with some useful links and version data.</li>
          <li>We slightly reworked the links in the about window of the tracker. It now goes FAQs, News, Privacy (shortened from Privacy Policy), Terms, Acknowledgements (previously: FAQ, News, Privacy Policy, Acknowledgements). We're sorry if this interrupts any muscle memory workflows.</li>
          <li>Minor feature additions and bug fixes across the site.</li>
        </ul>
        We're now just <b>nine</b> (<u>nine!</u>) days away from liftoff on April 11, 2020 at 2 AM EDT. We're working super hard to make sure the tracker is ready to go for launch on April 11. v4.5.1 will be the last release before launch, unless we find bugs in the mean time (in which case v4.5.2 will be the last release).

      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('43'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-43" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-43</a></span></p>
      <p>
        track.easterbunny.cc Version 4.5.0 is here, bringing new features to make streaming the tracking easier, along with minor features & fixes to make the tracker better overall. See what's new below!
        <ul>
          <li>You can now set tracker settings via URL arguments in environments where you can't directly interact with the tracker (such as an OBS browser source). All settings can be changed via arguments, along with the map zoom level and resetting settings. You can find the documentation for this new feature at <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/urlarguments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://track.easterbunny.cc/urlarguments</a>.</li>
          <li>A new pane of the settings window has been added - Advanced Settings. It contains a syntax checker for the new URL arguments feature, so you can make sure URL arguments are getting applied properly. There are also links to the full documentation as well.</li>
          <li>The @bunny_updates Twitter bot will now tweet out weather information for each stop, in addition to the existing last stop, next stop, and baskets delivered.</li>
          <li>We've updated the dark mode coloring ever so slightly. It is now a little darker.</li>
          <li>Twitter links to the @bunny_updates Twitter are present in all pages, including the main tracker.</li>
          <li>Fixed issues with inconsistent behavior of the local storage unavailable link popping out in a new tab (it should not have done that)</li>
          <li>You can now hover your mouse (on desktop) over the weather icon to read out the weather summary for that stop. The weather summary in stop information setting is available for mobile/tablet users.</li>
          <li>Added custom HTTP Error 403 & Error 500 pages, in addition to the HTTP Error 404 page we have now.</li>
          <li>Added time-based linking on the HTTP Error 403/404 page, so it properly redirects to the countdown or main tracker depending on the current time. This feature is also added to the now deprecated 2019 thank you page.</li>
          <li>Fixed the pre-tracking page so it properly redirects, and has up to date SEO information.</li>
          <li>Fixed potential issues with regex matching in the code not working properly, which could result in weird bugs.</li>
          <li>Fixed potential issues with basket icons not being properly positioned on the map.</li>
          <li>Minor improvements to the FAQ page</li>
          <li>Minor feature additions & bug fixes across the board</li>
        </ul>
        Version 4.5.0 is the last major release before tracking begins. We will continue to try and find any bugs in the tracker before liftoff in about 14 days, so keep your eyes peeled for Version 4.5.1/4.5.2 coming in the next week or so. <br><br>
        Tracking begins on April 11, 2020 at 2:00 AM EDT.

      <p class="lead">Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 4!</p>
      <p>Posted: March 22, 2020 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('37'); return false">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-37" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-37</a></span></p>
      <p>
        Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc Version 4! Over the past few months, we've been working hard on taking all the feedback we got last year, and using it to build a more well-rounded Easter Bunny Tracker for 2020. <br><br>
        Last year was a big year for us - the tracker officially launched and we made a name for ourselves. But, the tracker we had last year was pretty basic, to the point where many of you said that the tracker was too basic! <br><br>
        Version 4 was developed with the goal of keeping the foundation of track.easterbunny.cc virtually unchanged, and build in lots of quality-of-life improvements that bring the tracker to the next level. <br><br>
        Without further ado, here's the full changelog for Version 4 of track.easterbunny.cc!<br><br>
        <b>New Material Design</b> - We've updated the general look and feel of the tracker to that of a more modern, material design across the website. It should be less distracting, yet more visually appealing than last year. Once tracking gets under way, we hope you'll really enjoy the new design! <br><br>
        <b>Proper Light & Dark mode</b> - Last year, the tracker was in a mix of light and dark mode. This year, there's now proper, fully integrated light & dark modes across the tracker. You can let us figure out if your device is in light/dark mode or you can force light/dark mode if that's more your speed. This feature is also built in to the external pages using the sun icon in the top right of the page. If you're using iOS/macOS with automatic light/dark mode based on the sun, the tracker will automatically go in and out of dark mode.<br><br>
        <b>Tracker Customization</b> - It's here! A settings window! We'll talk about all the stuff you can customize later in the changelog, but just know that it's pretty awesome. It saves changes on the fly, and is specific to each browser that you visit the tracker on.<br><br>
        <b>Estimated arrival time for the Easter Bunny</b> - Similar to that of Google's estimated arrival time, we now have one for the Easter Bunny Tracker. It uses your IP address as an approximation so that we can estimate when the Easter Bunny will arrive in your location. You'll see the arrival estimate in the Next Stop box, and it'll hide when the Easter Bunny reaches your location. We've also included the option to turn this feature off in the settings window, which we recommend doing if you're streaming the tracker online. <br><br>
        A few quick notes on this feature. If you're using a VPN with the tracker, we'll calculate the estimated arrival time at the VPN server. You can load in the tracker without the VPN for a good estimate, or turn it off in settings. Additionally, if you're using a smaller phone (under 5 inches), the Easter Bunny icon on the map might be blocked by the arrival time text, so you may want to turn it off. <br><br>
        <b>Horizontal map shift on mobile devices</b> - Last year, the tracker was basically unusable on phones in landscape mode, as the top boxes ended up blocking the Easter Bunny icon. This year, we've fixed this issue by shifting the map down when in horizontal mode. The map will automatically unshift when in vertical mode, as well. On taller phones, you'll be able to see all three boxes and where the Easter Bunny is! <br><br>
        <b>Map modes are now changeable</b> - You can pick between Street, Satellite, and Hybrid map modes on the tracker. The best part? The street map has light & dark theming that is synced with the light/dark mode setting which is incredibly cool. <br><br>
        <b>The baskets are clickable! And show information when clicked!</b> - You can now click on a basket (that indicates cities the Easter Bunny has visited), and a window will now pop up with information about that city. Information includes arrival time, population, elevation, weather on arrival, and the first (and sometimes second) paragraph from Wikipedia. A link to the Wikipedia article for that city is also shown as well. <br><br>
        <b>Pre-tracking has been integrated into the main tracker</b> - This means that there's only one redirect during tracking - from the countdown to the pre-tracking. We've done this to streamline the codebase, and next year we plan to integrate the countdown into the tracker as well for zero redirects. <br><br>
        <b>Pre-tracking updates are now more frequent</b> - You should see about 30-50% more updates during pre-tracking than last year, with a maximum gap of 5 minutes between updates. <br><br>
        <b>Stop detection has been improved</b> - We're now picking up about 30% more stops that the Easter Bunny makes this year. This change will be especially noticeable in the US, where last year tracking got a bit boring due to the lack of stops. <br><br>
        <b>Persistent uncenter/recenter Easter Bunny button (during tracking)</b> - Did you know that last year you could click the Easter Bunny to uncenter and recenter the map? I'm assuming you said no. We've ditched this in favor of a persistent button that appears during tracking. <br><br>
        <b>Bunny bouncing effect is here!</b> - We heard your calls to enable a bouncing effect for the Easter Bunny last year. You can now enable the option for the bunny bouncing effect in the Map Settings part of the settings window. Just note that enabling this will cause increased CPU usage, and lower battery life on mobile devices. <br><br>
        <b>Optimal livestreaming settings</b> - In the new settings window under Reset Settings, we've included some optimized settings for streaming the tracker online. <br><br>
        <b>External page improvements abound</b> - There's been lots of updates & changes to the external pages (like this one) in the tracker. We've updated the FAQs so that there's more of them and that the writing is also clearer. The news page has post IDs for easy sharing, and the privacy policy and acknowledgements pages have been rewritten. <br><br>
        <b>Page structure update</b> - Last year, all pages were linked with .html. This year, all pages now have their own directory on the server. You can still visit .html pages, and you'll be automatically redirected to the right place. <br><br>
        <b>Site slogan update (again)</b> - Now, the slogan is "Track the Easter Bunny in real-time with our Easter Bunny Tracker as the Easter Bunny delivers baskets and eggs to homes around the world!". <br><br>
        <b>Tracker requirements update</b> - This year, we are no longer supporting Internet Explorer 10. Otherwise, the tracker requirements have stayed the same, although there are some known issues on older browsers. We plan to bump up the tracker requirements for next year, but we also plan to add a basic mode for incompatible browsers. <br><br>
        <b>Stream attribution requirement has been dropped</b> - Since the tracker is not brand new and more people know about us, we are no longer requiring that you attribute the tracker in the description of live streams of the tracker. However, since the tracker still pretty new, we recommend that you keep the attribution. <br><br>
        <b>A bunch of other smaller changes: </b><br>
        <b>-</b> The tracker is zoomed out to zoom level 5 on mobile phones, compared to zoom level 6 elsewhere. If you're not a fan of this on mobile, just click the zoom key once, and you're good to go. If you do uncenter/recenter the map, the tracker will go back to the appropriate zoom level for your device, so make any adjustments after this process is complete. We're looking into a way to customize the default zoom level for the 2021 run.<br>
        <b>-</b> Add to homescreen has been modified, you'll now see a shorter name on your homescreen (Easter Bunny Tracker -> Bunny Tracker) <br>
        <b>-</b> Incompatible browser detection has been improved <br>
        <b>-</b> Improved the movement of the Easter Bunny on the map <br>
        <b>-</b> Reworked how the baskets delivered counter works <br>
        <b>-</b> The question mark from last year is now an info button that pops up a window with how to use the tracker along with links to FAQs, Privacy Policy, Acknowledgements, News <br>
        <b>-</b> Automatic updates on how the Easter Bunny is doing are available through @bunny_updates thanks to a new Twitter bot we developed in-house. We're using a separate Twitter as we don't want to spam your feed with tons of tweets come Easter! The main Twitter will be tweeting general status updates every 20-30 minutes. <br>
        <b>-</b> Numerous other minor feature additions, along with numerous bug fixes from last year <br>
        <br><br>
        <b>And some notes: </b><br>
        <b>-</b> For everyone who used the countdown as part of your stream last year, the position of it has unchanged this year. <br>
        <b>-</b> The tracker is heavier this year - with total assets of about 2 MB. You'll need a decent connection to load the tracker. Additionally, the tracker will be slower on older devices, so please be patient. <br>
        <b>-</b> We're working on updating the FAQ, Privacy Policy, Acknowledgements, and News pages to bring you back to the countdown or the tracker depending on what state they're in. This feature will be added in Version 4.4.1, which should be out by the 26th. <br>
        <b>-</b> If you're still seeing v3.8.2 when you visit track.easterbunny.cc, please wait about 4 hours for your browser to uncache the previous countdown page, and cache the new one. You can also clear your cache manually as well. <br>
        <br><br>
        The Easter Bunny will start making final preparations starting on April 11, 2020 at 2:00 AM EDT, before lifting off three hours later on April 11, 2020 at 5:00 AM EDT. Tracking will end 25 hours later, on April 12, 2020 at 6:00 AM EDT.
        <br><br>
        Once tracking is complete, the website will be kept up until May 12, so you can explore and learn about all the places the Easter Bunny visited during his journey!
        <br><br>
        We're super excited to launch Version 4 of the tracker, and we hope you're excited to track the Easter Bunny with us! We hope that all the changes we've made make the tracking experience more enjoyable.

      <p>
        With 40 days until liftoff, we're working really, really, really hard to get the tracker in shape for liftoff. <br><br>
        Quality assurance, also known as QA, has been the main focus for the past few weeks. We've now completed about 5300 QA runs of the tracker, and are 47% complete with QA as of this post. While doing QA, we've found just under 300 bugs or areas of improvement for the tracker, and we're busy ensuring that the tracker works as best as it can for everyone come Easter. <br><br>
        We're proud to announce that track.easterbunny.cc v4 is launching on March 29, 2020 - that's in 29 days! We don't have a set launch time as of yet (but we're working on it), with more details to come in a Development Update 4 in Mid-March. <br><br>
        In the mean time, we're adding a few more features here and there throughout the tracker. A feature planned is that we'll have appearance switchers on the FAQ & News page, so that you can quickly set the appearance mode on these pages, which will also propagate through to the rest of the tracker. Otherwise, it's mostly super minor stuff that we're implementing right now as we continue to roll through QA at a mighty pace. <br><br>
        We understand that some of you smart people may realize that in the last post, we said we were 10% done, and we're 37% more done in 20 days, so how will we manage to do 53% of QA in 29 days? Magic. Magic is key here. Also we're a lot further in the QA process, so we're not finding as many bugs. Pinky promise it'll be done on time.<br><br>
        After the March 29 release date, we'll be working hard on more of the infrastructure & social side of the tracker. We have a new Twitter account for all the automated Easter Bunny updates (@bunny_updates). We didn't feel like spamming your main feed with a boatload (~500-600) of status updates in 28 hours (thank the 30% better stop detection for this one), but we will be tweeting status updates from our main twitter every 15-30 minutes (that's about 112 updates for those playing along at home). We'll see how this goes. We're also in the process of rewriting the privacy policy page - which should be out in the next week or so. We want to be as transparent as possible with how the tracker works in regards to your privacy, and the current privacy policy page is confusing, badly worded, and isn't doing a good job of being a privacy policy.<br><br>
        We're really, really, really excited for not only launching v4 in 29 days, but the liftoff in 40 days. We'll have another development update out in about 15-20 days, so stay on the lookout for that! <br><br>
        We also promise not to put bad Easter music on our website. We ain't about that, chief.

        With 62 days until liftoff, we're continuing to work on the tracker. This development update highlights some of the changes we've been able to make, and where we're going next.<br><br>
        The tracker is comsidered pre-QA (quality assurance) complete. This means that the tracker is done, but not fully bug tested. We are in the middle of quality assurance right now, with about 10% completion. We've found about 14 bugs already, and we expect to find lots more as QA continues to run on. <br><br>
        We've updated the tracker with an estimated arrival time for the Easter Bunny, which is a super cool, very awesome feature. It uses a custom Geo API that we built to get your approximate location based on your IP address. For people who stream onto YouTube, we also have the option to turn this off as to not reveal your location. We've also added streamer optimized settings to the tracker, so that when the tracker goes live, you can set the settings to what we feel gives the best experience on stream. This brings the tracker to virtual parity with Google Santa Tracker.<br><br>
        We've also upgraded the countdown to the new design, so that you can customize the settings during the countdown. We also made it so that in the info box, it will show localized times of when pre-tracking starts, and tracking starts. <br><br>
        The Acknowledgements, FAQ, Privacy Policy, and News page have been updated. The first change is that they are under their own directory, instead of a .html page. The second change is that they sport the refreshed design. What you're seeing now is the new refreshed design. We hope you like it. The news page also has the ability to share a specific post, post IDs, and hash linking. <br><br>
        The new Twitter Bot for this year is working great, and we're excited to use it! It covers pre-tracking and tracking, from start to finish. We've coded it so that it has a similar style to what was being manually tweeted out last year (including an abbreviated basket count). <br><br>
        In the next 4 weeks, we're planning to run lots, and lots of QA on the tracker. After that is completed, we'll be launching! The anticipated launch date is in mid-March, with no specific date set. <br><br>
        That is all for development update 2. The next development update will be posted in about 20 days.

      <p>
        With 83 days until the Easter Bunny lifts off for his 2020 journey, we've been working super hard on the tracker. This first development update highlights what we've done so far, and what we're working on next. <br><br>
        The biggest change thus far is the refreshed UI for the tracker, and as a result this part is 99% done. Dark mode integration is working great with the map (it switches into dark mode when the site goes into dark mode). The settings UI is also working great, and we've added a new about UI as well. Lastly, there's now a persistent uncenter/recenter button, which is almost finished. <br><br>
        We're also working hard on fixing up the backend of the tracker. Earlier this month, the issues with inconsistent basket counts and movement glitches got fixed. We've also fixed some edge-case issues with placing baskets on the map. There's lots of additional hard work going on to ensure that the tracker is more stable and less resource-intensive than last year. <br><br>
        Regarding the Easter Bunny's stops - we've made some major changes to the experience on the tracker. In addition to seeing short Wikipedia descriptions and data about each stop that the Easter Bunny visits, we've also added in weather data from Dark Sky for each stop on arrival. This feature isn't entirely completed yet (there's still some changes that we need to make to the user experience), but so far it's working great. <br><br>
        With all of this out of the way, for the rest of January, we'll be working on more tracker improvements and ironing out bugs. In addition, we'll be integrating pre-tracking into the main tracker, so the only redirection that occurs is from countdown to pre-tracking. Speaking of the countdown, we'll be propagating the changes we've made from the tracker to the countdown page as to keep things consistent. <br><br>
        That is all for development update 1. The next development update will be posted in about 30-45 days!

      <p>With 100 days remaining until liftoff, we're excited to announce the final changelist for Version 4 of track.easterbunny.cc. Version 4 builds on Version 3 of the tracker, all the while improving the basics but also providing a better experience in general. Here's what's coming!</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>UI update inbound! It'll be more modern, with a new settings panel to customize aspects of the tracker experience, applied throughout the countdown, pre-tracking, and tracking.</li>
        <li>Dark mode support? Oh yes, and with a dark theme for the map! We'll even automatically detect your system preference (if you're running a newer OS).</li>
        <li>We're switching the default map mode to street this year, but you'll now have the option to select from satellite & hybrid mode.</li>
        <li>A lot of you asked for better stop detection last year in the tracker, and this year, we're offering just that. Based on preliminary testing, we're now detecting about 25% more stops from last year!</li>
        <li>We've already fixed a major issue that plagued the tracker last year - inconsistent basket delivered counts and weird movement glitches.</li>
        <li>Want to learn more about the places where the Easter Bunny visits this year? You can do just that, clicking on a basket will bring up information about a stop's information, with links to Wikipedia to go even deeper.</li>
        <li>With the v4 update, you'll be able to <b><i>turn on a bunny bouncing effect on the map</i></b>. A lot of you asked for this, and we're happy to deliver.</li>
        <li>We'll be rewording the privacy pages, incompatible tracker pages, FAQ pages, you get the point.</li>
        <li>Our social media presence will be vastly improved as well. We will have automated systems to update our Twitter page when the Easter Bunny reaches a new stop, instead of trying to manually tweet out updates from Twitter for Android.</li>
        <li>We'll be making sure that all of the external tools we use will be up-to-date!</li>
        <li>We'll be trying to structure the tracker all under one URL roof this year, so that you don't have to deal with countdown pages and all that other nonsense. We can't guarantee that this will happen, but we will try. At the very least, we'll be removing the .html in the URL bar for all the different pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We look forward to bringing all of these changes to you this year. Look out for development updates on our Twitter starting in late January for more!</p>

      <h3>Version 3 - 2019</h3>
      <hr class="styledhr" id="pid-21">
      <p class="lead">Thank you for an amazing Easter 2019!</p>
      <p>Posted: April 21, 2019 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('21')">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-21" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-21</a></span></p>
      <p>Wow, just wow. These three words perfectly sum up Easter 2019, our first year of operations of track.easterbunny.cc. <br>
      In March, we set off to create a tracking experience that you'd never forget, and from the looks of things we've created an experience that so many of you will remember for years to come. <br>
      <br>
      Since 12 AM EDT on April 20, track.easterbunny.cc has received over 4,000 visits, and over 18,000 requests for site assets made. Additionally, CloudFlare registered over 2,400 unique visitors to the site, and over 100 MB of tracker assets were served - for such a lightweight tracker this is unbelieveable.<br>
      We estimate that during the crossover from pre-tracking to tracking at 5 AM EDT, nearly 220 people were using our site, and everyone was redirected without issue.
      We'd like to give a massive thank you to everyone who enjoyed the tracker this year. We thought that we would likely get one-tenth of the traffic that we ended up receiving, and it's simply mind-boggling to see how many people discovered our tracker in such a short period of time.<br>
      <br>
      Our first year of running track.easterbunny.cc was a bit different than normal, because for extended periods of time we were the only Easter Bunny Tracker operating on the internet, due to more popular sites going down from high loads of traffic. <br>
      While we expected some issues due to traffic, we ended up having no issues. CloudFlare helped out tremendously with taking a huge load off of our servers. The transitions from the countdown to pre-tracking, and pre-tracking to tracking went flawlessly, and the site remained up even during the busiest hours of tracking. <br>
      <br>
      From the bottom of our hearts from the track.easterbunny.cc Team, thank you for a first year that we will never forget. Over the summer and winter, major upgrades will be brought along to the tracker to take your Easter Bunny Tracking experience to a whole new level. We've also been listening to feedback on our site and where we can improve, and we'll be taking that feedback to make our site even better. <br>
      Our site will remain online until May 1, 2019 so that you can explore the map, and see where the Easter Bunny has been. If you're on a laptop or desktop computer, hover over the baskets with your mouse cursor - you'll get extra information on stops!
      <br>
      After tracking the Easter Bunny's preparations & movements for 28 hours, and after successfully delivering 4.022 billion baskets, it's time we say goodbye for 2019. Thank you all for an incredible year, and we cannot wait for 2020!<br>
      <br>
      Happy Easter to you and your family, <br>

      <p class="lead">Tips for getting the most out of your tracking experience</p>
      <p>Posted: April 20, 2019 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('18')">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-18" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-18</a></span></p>
      <p>
      Given that this is our first year of operations, you might not know how our tracker will work. That's okay, as we've compiled a quick list of tips to get the most out of your tracking experience. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>1. No refreshing is required, no auto-refresh plugins are needed</h4>
      You probably know this by now, but our tracker doesn't require any refreshing. Think of our tracker as the NORAD of Easter Bunny Tracking, you don't need auto-refreshing plugins to constantly update the site. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>2. You'll be automatically redirected from the countdown to pre-tracking, then to tracking</h4>
      Similar to how NORAD runs their tracker, you'll be automatically redirected every step of the way, no matter what device you're on. If you manage to leave your laptop or phone closed on the countdown, and then turn it on when tracking is active, you'll get properly redirected. No links to click, no nothing! <br>
      <br>
      <h4>3. You can still change your zoom level when the map is centered on the Easter Bunny</h4>
      As the title for this tip says, you can zoom in/out as much as you'd like an stay centered on the bunny, even if your zoom in/out gestures get a bit messy. Just remember - don't zoom in too far, or the map will constantly be loading in satellite imagery and you'll have a poor experience. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>4. You can set the view of the tracker back to default by clicking twice on the Easter Bunny</h4>
      Uncentering, then recentering the Easter Bunny will set the tracker to the proper zoom level and positioning, if you want to return to the default map view of the tracker. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>5. Need to zoom in on the whole tracker page? Use Firefox or Edge.</h4>
      There are known issues with Chrome where zooming in on the entire tracker page will cause annoying gray lines between map tiles. Use Firefox or Edge if you want to zoom in on the tracker page, but don't want a degraded tracking experience. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>6. Set your bookmarks to track.easterbunny.cc for the best possible loading times during tracking</h4>
      I know that this may be tricky given that the tracker will bring you to the countdown page, but if you can, bookmark the tracker, but modify the URL to just https://track.easterbunny.cc. It'll get you to the tracking super fast when it starts. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>7. Have a little patience when you are redirecting to pre-tracking and tracking</h4>
      Although we're doing our best to ensure that the redirection process should go smoothly, we can't confidently say that the site won't have any issues come 2 AM & 5 AM EDT on April 20, when the pre-tracking & tracking redirections occur. Please be patient when these times roll around, and wait about 10-20 seconds for pre-tracking/tracking to load. If it takes longer, manually refresh the page. <br>
      <br>
      <h4>8. Have fun and share the love of Easter Bunny Tracking</h4>
      Just have some fun and track the Easter Bunny! That's what we're here for, and will always be about.

        <li>Fixed a bug where zoom keys during tracking would not work due to improper styling.</li>

      If you forgot, pre-tracking starts on April 20, 2019 at 2:00 AM EDT, and tracking starts on April 20, 2019 at 5:00 AM EDT. <br>

      <p class="lead">Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc!</p>
      <p>Posted: March 16, 2019 <br>
      <a class="sharelink" onclick="return sharemodal('1')">Share this article</a><span class="sharelink-legacy" style="display: none">Share this article: <a href="https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-1" class="linkwrap">https://track.easterbunny.cc/news/#pid-1</a></span></p>
      <p>Welcome to track.easterbunny.cc! I'm really excited that you're here. <br>
        So, you're probably wondering who runs this site, and what this site even does. Time for a bit of history. <br>
        <br>
        I'm eastmountainfilms, you might know me from my pretty popular tracking streams on YouTube. <br>
        Last year, a few months before my first Easter Bunny Tracker live stream, the site I would use, TheCPTrackers, was up for domain renewal. TrackEasterBunny quickly bought the domain out and redirected it to their site. <br>
        I hate TrackEasterBunny - and a lot of you probably hate it too. It's got too much going on at once, the actual tracker is a nightmare given you need to refresh it to get the latest data, and overall, it's a nightmare. <br>
        That's why last year, I made my own tracker in about 3 weeks, with data being streamed from Easter Island. The only issue? It was private, very hacky, and was nowhere near able to being published online. <br>
        <br>
        So, for 2019, I wanted to step up my game. Make a tracker on the level of NORAD & Google's Santa Trackers, because the world deserves a better Easter Bunny Tracker. And that's just what I did. <br>
        I'm really excited to share what we've been cooking up for this tracker. Below are just a few of the reasons why this site can easily be considered the best Easter Bunny Tracker out there. <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Modern design:</b> I'm really happy to say that this tracker does not look like it was born in 2009. The year is 2019, and for that, modern design is key. A lot of work has been put into making the tracker look great, yet minimal on all devices. We're proud to say that our tracker won't ruin your eyes.</li>
          <li><b>No more refreshing:</b> That's right! We're the only Easter Bunny Tracker that doesn't require any refreshing. Our advanced algorithms mean that the tracker keeps itself updated. Even better? You can leave our tracker running in the background for 24 hours, come back, and it'll have the latest data. It's like magic.</li>
          <li><b>Mobile optimization:</b> It's a fact: Nowadays, people browse more on their phones & tablets than on laptops & desktops. That's why we put a lot of thought into making the tracker run great on both desktops and mobile phones, unlike some other trackers out on the internet. Plus, when you add our site to the homescreen of a mobile phone, our tracker will basically run as an app.</li>
          <li><b>Simplicity:</b> Unlike other Easter Bunny trackers, this tracker was designed for one thing, and one thing only - tracking. Our site isn't bloated up with games and other useless stuff, our site just has the tracking. That's why this is here. Just for tracking.</li>
          <li><b>Speed:</b> While our site isn't the fastest website around, it is the fastest tracker around. Page speed tests show that our tracker consistently loads faster than Track Easter Bunny, and uses less data - especially important for mobile users. No refreshing means even more data savings when using the tracker for extended periods of time. Additionally, we've built in systems to make sure that the tracker won't go down on Easter.</li>
          <li><b>Pre-tracking:</b> Thanks to our folks on Easter Island, we're the only tracker around to offer pre-tracking. This means that three hours before liftoff, you'll be getting the latest updates on the Easter Bunny's prepartaions before his journey.</li>
          <li><b>Privacy:</b> We're really keen on privacy. That's why our site doesn't have any ads, or any trackers installed to haunt you while visiting our website - and no Facebook popups either.</li>
       </ul>
       <br>
       I hope this list has really convinced you that we're the right tracker to be using this Easter season - and we can't wait to share it with you all. <br>
       <br>
       Curious for when all the action unfolds? Here's the timeline:
       <br><ul>
         <li>Pre-Tracking: April 20, 2019 from 2 AM EDT to 5 AM EDT</li>
         <li>Tracking: April 20 - 21, 2019 from 5 AM EDT 4/20 to 6 AM EDT 4/21</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Once tracking is complete, the website will be kept up until May 21, so you can explore where the Easter Bunny went on his journey. <br>
      We hope that you will enjoy tracking the Easter Bunny with us this year. Please look forward to when tracking begins on April 20, 2019. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Please note: If you intend on streaming this tracker to YouTube, Twitch, etc, you will need to put the link to track.easterbunny.cc in the description of your stream. We will actually be checking streams to ensure that there is proper attribution.</b>
      <br><br>
      (2020 update: You don't actually need attribution to stream the tracker. We required this for the first year as the tracker was very new. However, we'd still really appreciate it if you put the tracker link in the description of your stream so that more people are aware of our tracker!)
