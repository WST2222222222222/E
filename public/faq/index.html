            <div class="card-body maintext-override">
              There's so much that's new! The tracker has been completely rewritten from the ground up for better long-term maintainability, features a brand new user interface with a slicker and more modern design. The Easter Bunny now stops at each stop while retaining our world-class stop accuracy. The settings modal has gotten lots of love and has been improved for a better experience. We've improved our stop accuracy even more this year, made the tracker even smoother by default, and continued to add more functionality.

            <div class="card-body maintext-override">
              Yes. Any settings you had previously set for v5 will be carried over to v6. If your default map zoom level was 12 or higher, it'll be reduced to 11 to account for the new stop arrival animations.

            <div class="card-body maintext-override">
              Nope! Even with all the changes we've made, the tracker remains compatible with all browsers that worked with Version 5. This includes Chrome 48 or higher, Firefox 52 or higher, and Safari 9 or higher. <br><br>
              As a note, the best experience for TEBCC will be on modern browsers that are about a year old or newer (Safari 15+, Chrome 79+, Firefox 70ish+). If you're using an older brower, you may see some features not work as intended because we try to port newer functionalities we use to older browsers (but these backports aren't perfect). <br><br>
              You'll also likely see slower performance on older devices, you can try to improve performance using the optimize settings for low performance defaults.

            track.easterbunny.cc provides real-time updates on the Easter Bunny's whereabouts every second for the 25 hours that the Easter Bunny is making deliveries. The Easter Bunny starts making deliveries west of the international date line, slowly progressing west across the world until returning to Easter Island.

              The Easter Bunny will arrive at your home sometime between 9 PM and 2 AM local time. Make sure that you are asleep when the Easter Bunny comes, as if you are not, the Easter Bunny may not be able to deliver your baskets and eggs. <br><br>
              You can keep tabs on when the Easter Bunny is estimated to arrive in the next stop box. If there is no arrival estimate, check the tracker settings to make sure the arrival estimate time is on.

              Since 2019, track.easterbunny.cc has exclusively partnered with the Easter Bunny's helpers to provide an insider look at the Easter Bunny's final preparations for 3 hours before liftoff. During final preparations (also known as pre-tracking), you'll get updates every 2.5 minutes straight from Easter Island on how the Easter Bunny is preparing for liftoff. <br><br>
              Once final preparations are complete and the Easter Bunny lifts off, the tracker will transition from final preparation mode into tracking mode.

              In 2022, the Easter Bunny visited the islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu first, approximately 5-15 minutes after departure. <br><br>
              About 25 hours later, the Easter Bunny visited the islands of French Polynesia and the Pitcairn Islands before returning home to Easter Island. <br><br>
              Every year, the Easter Bunny usually follows this pattern for the first & last stop, but the specific stops may be different from year to year.

              We use real-time satellite imagery, alongside traditional radar tracking and other modern technologies that allows us to track the Easter Bunny with extremely high accuracy. This allows us to bring you updates on the Easter Bunny's whereabouts every second! <br><br>
              We've continued to upgrade the technology we use so that our tracker can show more of the stops the Easter Bunny makes. For instance, in 2019, we detected about 400 stops, whereas in 2020 we detected about 600 stops. We expect to detect approximately 900-1000 stops in 2023 as we continue to upgrade our technology. <br><br>
              We continue to be the most accurate Easter Bunny Tracker on the planet with our highly advanced technology.

              This is a known issue with the Google Maps that we use when the page is zoomed in at higher than 100% zoom level (or your display is at a scale of 100% or higher). This issue only affects Chrome and browsers based on the Blink engine (the one Chrome uses). <br><br>
              We have a setting in the Map tab of settings where you can enable a setting to try and fix these lines. You'll see this come up if we detect you're using a browser effected by this. <br><br>
              We're also aware that Firefox on Desktop has a slight issue where the map "warps" when the Easter Bunny moves when the page is zoomed in.

              As we continue to build new features into the tracker, using older devices with the tracker will usually result in some lag and generally be slower. If this is the case on your device, we recommend enabling the low performance mode default settings, which will try to lower the impact of the tracker CPU usage as much as possible. <br><br>
              Generally speaking, you should be able to use the tracker on any modern phone from 2017/2018 onward or a modern laptop from 2012-2013 onward without too much lag. <br><br>
              If going into low-performance settings doesn't do the trick, you can always search "easter bunny tracker live stream" on YouTube, and you'll usually find plenty of people streaming track.easterbunny.cc.

              Yes you can! You can customize how often the tracker updates. By default, the tracker updates the Easter Bunny marker at a rate of 5 FPS (frames/updates per second), and metrics at 10 FPS for v6.0. <br><br>
              You can customize the smoothness in 5 different levels. The update intervals for these settings are listed below:
              <ul>
                <li>Slowest: Marker at 1 FPS, Metrics at 5 FPS (default prior to v5.6)</li>
                <li>Slower: Marker at 2 FPS, Metrics at 10 FPs</li>
                <li>Default: Marker at 5 FPS, Metrics at 10 FPS</li>
                <li>Smoother: Marker at 10 FPS, Metrics at 10 FPS</li>
                <li>Smoothest: Marker at 20 FPS, Metrics at 20 FPS</li>
              </ul>
              Keep in mind a few additional notes:

              Yes you can! There's three different ways you can make the tracker fullscreen. <br><br>
              The first way is by using the fullscreen button that's built into the tracker that's new in v6. You can find it at the bottom left of the screen with the same icon for this FAQ. Once you click it, the tracker will be in fullscreen! Then, you can click the button again whenever you wish to exit fullscreen. <br><br>
              Please note that the fullscreen button isn't available on all browsers, namely Safari support is missing. We're hoping to expand support for this feature to additional browsers soon. <br><br>
              The second way is by installing the tracker as an app on your homescreen. This process depends on your browser but usually you want to find something like "Add to homescreen". On Safari you can find this by tapping the share sheet, on Chrome you can find this by clicking the three dots in the top right. <br><br>
              The third and final way is by using your browser's native fullscreen capabilities. How you enter fullscreen will depend on your specific browser. This may result in tabs being visible in fullscreen so that's why we recommend you use our fullscreen button whenever possible.

              As with anything complicated, it depends! <br><br>
              By default, the arrival estimate is accurate to within about 15 minutes of the Easter Bunny's arrival time, and the distance from you metric is accurate to about ~100 km/mi from your location. We use your IP address as an imprecise location estimate to give you an idea of when the Easter Bunny will arrive and far away the Easter Bunny is. But because it's IP based, you'll likely experience slightly inaccurate results in mobile data, and VPNs will produce inaccurate results. <br><br>
              Beginning in Version 6.1, you can opt for the tracker to query your actual location to enhance the accuracy of the arrival time and distance from you metric. When you do this, the arrival time estimate will go down to the stop, and the distance from you metric will be visible at all times (with much finer accuracy compared to your approximate location). Enabling this bypasses any inaccuracies you may get from your estimated location if you're using a VPN or mobile data. You can enable this precision location by clicking the settings button, going to the localization tab, then clicking "Precise" under Your location accuracy.

              Not at this time. We are focused on developing track.easterbunny.cc as a great web app first and foremost so we can reach as many devices as possible. However, on both iOS and Android, you can add the tracker to your homescreen so it behaves like an app. <br><br>
              On iOS - click the Share button in Safari, then scroll down and click Add to Home Screen. The tracker will then get added to your homescreen and launch as a fullscreen app! <br><br>
              On Android (at least in Chrome) - click the three dots in the top right, then click Install. The tracker will install itself as an app on your homescreen. <br><br>
              When you add the tracker to your homescreen, your settings won't carry over from your browser and will start from fresh. Also note that the tracker is not a PWA (progressive web app), although we're looking to introduce support for this in v7 of the tracker.

              It's super easy with the help of our Easter Bunny Tracker - no guess work required. Our tracker provides a distance from you metric so you can easily see how far the Easter Bunny is from you. Make sure you click the right & left arrow icons in the metrics box (right side of the screen when 2 or 3 boxes are visible) to scroll to the Distance from you metric. If you're on mobile, click the settings button in the bottom left corner, click the Metrics tab, and you'll be able to switch the metrics to Distance from you there. <br><br>
              While you're in settings, consider visiting the Localization tab and switching your location accuracy to Precise. Doing so will enhance accuracy for the Distance from you metric and make it update more frequently!

              Yes, but with one big caveat. track.easterbunny.cc is licensed under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license, which requires you to pay your changes forward. If you use our source code, modify it, then release your tracker to the public, you are legally required to make your modified source code available (on GitLab, GitHub, etc) under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license, and document changes made. <br><br>
              The same principle applies if you incorporate the tracker code under a larger system, in that you are required to release the source code for that larger system (exceptions are made for integrating the tracker into a CMS system such as WordPress, Drupal, etc) under GNU AGPL v3.0. If you're confused about if you need to release your larger system's source code, get in touch with us and we can work things out. <br><br>

              track.easterbunny.cc launched in 2019 with a mission to revolutionize Easter Bunny Tracking. We believed the world deserved better when it came to Easter Bunny Tracking - and wanted to make an Easter Bunny Tracker similar in quality to NORAD & Google's Santa Trackers. <br><br>
              Before 2019, Easter Bunny Tracking was limited to one or two websites that constantly crashed, didn't have live updates, required refreshing to get the latest updates, no moving maps, and seemed to focus more about the experience around Easter Bunny Tracking rather than the tracker itself. <br><br>
              In 2019, we revolutionized Easter Bunny Tracking with track.easterbunny.cc Version 3. For the first time in history, anyone could track the Easter Bunny in real-time, with a moving map, and pre-tracking. We focused heavily on building the logic for a real-time Easter Bunny Tracker, which meant the tracker design was quite barebones (which many of our users pointed out!). Nonetheless, we showed off what was possible with the future of Easter Bunny Tracking. We even got a nice amount of traffic - about 4,000 hits over 28 hours of tracking. <br><br>
              In 2020, we built on the foundation from Version 3, and revolutionized Easter Bunny Tracking again with track.easterbunny.cc Version 4. With a brand new material design, tracker customization that had never been seen before, estimated arrival times for the Easter Bunny, built-in information about the Easter Bunny's stops, enhanced mobile usability, and tons of new features, the future of Easter Bunny Tracking came to life. All these improvements mean we grew by a whopping 850% compared to 2019's run of track.easterbunny.cc, with a total of 35,000 hits and 14,000 unique visitors from around the world. <br><br>
              For 2021, we focused on making a more refined, customizable, and better tracker with track.easterbunny.cc Version 5. With new features such as metric customization, metrics on mobile devices, more accurate Easter Bunny arrival estimates, better stop detection, map customization, better localization, these small changes meant that we grew by nearly 300% to post 102,000 hits during the course of tracking.<br><br>
              While 2022 was the year we rested on our laurels, we still made some improvements to the tracker - like flags in last seen/next stop, smooth movement, and other minor improvements. But so did the other trackers, and for the fourth year running, we continued to provide a world-class tracking experience. This meant the tracker posted 127,000 hits, a growth of 124% from the year before. <br><br>
              For 2023, we've focused on rebuilding the entire tracker from the ground up, preparing us for the future of the tracker. This includes a brand new user interface with a modern design, new features to the core of tracking such as stop arrivals, fullscreen support, better user localization features, and of course lots of little tweaks to make the Easter Bunny tracking experience even better than the year before. <br><br>
              Although we may not be the first nor the biggest Easter Bunny Tracker (and we're quite content with that!), our mission is to provide one of the best Easter Bunny tracking experiences on the internet. We're constantly innovating year after year and always thinking of new ways to make tracking more immersive and exciting than the year before.

Watching Santa fly up the East Coast and then hop into bed was an experience each and every year. Of course as I grew older I stopped tracking Santa, but it was always fun to log onto the websites occasionally and see where he was on Christmas Eve. <br><br>
              Cue some random December 2017, and I remembered Santa Tracking existed and wondered, hey, does anyone stream it on YouTube? What I found was a patchwork of less-than-stellar streams, and I knew the world deserved better. I fired up OBS, threw up two trackers and some jazz, and got 100,000 views. I still run these streams yearly every year (even though many other big channels have caught onto this and the days of 100k views are long gone). <br><br>
              It was around this time that I also was introduced to Easter Bunny Tracking. It was a similar concept for Santa, except the Easter Bunny! And what's better than having this awesome tracking experience twice. When I was setting up for my first Easter Bunny tracking stream, I saw that almost all trackers on the internet were subpar and didn't hold a candle to NORAD or Google's Santa Trackers. Furthermore, the site I planned to use (The CP Trackers) went down weeks before the stream. That left Track Easter Bunny as the only site up, a site with a reputation of crashing often during tracking and requiring auto-refresh plugins to get the latest data. Yikes. <br><br>
              For the 2018 stream, I hacked together a custom Easter Bunny Tracker in WordPress (that still required auto-refresh plugins) and it was hugely successful. People wanted to know what the link was for the tracker! And I couldn't give it out for security reasons due to the hacky nature of it. This inspired me for a huge challenge in 2019 as I started my web development career - make a live Easter Bunny Tracker like Google and NORAD for my stream. Eventually I decided to make this tracker public (after all, why not?), launching track.easterbunny.cc Version 3 (v1 is the 2018 tracker, v2 is the private tracker, this is why we started at v3). <br><br>
              Since 2019, I've been working on track.easterbunny.cc as a side project in my spare time, slowly but surely making the tracker the best it can be over the last 5 years. It's been quite a challenging project to work on and it's definitely not easy to run the entire show by myself, but it's been an amazing learning experience and has pushed my webdev skills to the limit yearly. Although it's mostly been me the entire time, but I have to give huge credits to folks in my Discord server who helped with v4 development, and who still help out today by testing development versions of the tracker and report bugs back to me. <br><br>
              So that's who's behind the tracker! You have my big thanks for checking out the site, perusing around, and enjoying the tracker.

              For the fifth year in operation, track.easterbunny.cc continues to be ad-free. I had originally planned to put ads on the website for 2023 but I found that I was unable to hit a reasonable compromise with putting ads on the website in a non-intrusive way, while also ensuring they would work for the launch of the tracker. <br><br>
              For 2024, we are planning to put ads in the tracker, notably in the info modal, settings modal, and the countdown screen. The actual core tracker will not contain ads.  <br><br>
              Nonetheless, costs of the tracker will likely exceed $1,000 for the 2023 run due to the Google Maps API (they bill per map load past 28,000 hits and we've exceeded this for 3 years running). If you enjoy tracking with our tracker, please, consider donating! <br><br>
              As a compromise for 2023, there is a 1/2 chance you will see a banner 120 seconds after loading the tracker indicating the option to donate.

              Orthodox Easter is a holiday celebrated by Orthodox Christians to celebrate Jesus' resurrection. The date for Orthodox Christian date for Easter generally occurs later than the Easter date observed by western churches, as it is celebrated on the Easter Sunday date in the Julian calendar, compared to the Gregorian calendar for western Easter. <br><br>
              Orthodox Easter celebrate "the miracle of Easter" on the Easter Sunday date in the Julian calendar. Preparations for Orthodox Easter begin with 40 days of strict fasting before Easter Sunday. Additionally, many Orthodox Christians attend liturgies during the Holy Week that leads up to Easter Sunday.

              track.easterbunny.cc provides a sister service known as track.orthodoxbunny.cc to track the Easter Bunny's second run for Orthodox Easter.

              Both of the trackers will be virtually the same. We plan to reflect a lower baskets delivered count in track.orthodoxbunny.cc. Since Orthodox Easter has a strong connection to Greece, we plan to show more stops in Greece compared to the normal Easter Bunny Tracker. <br><br>
              We welcome any other suggestions on how we can differentiate the Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker.
